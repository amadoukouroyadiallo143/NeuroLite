 In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in Ordu ( Turkey ) , M. inclinata was found to have comparatively high levels of iron ( 628 mg per kg ) and nickel ( 21 @.@ 6 mg / kg ) , measured on a dry weight basis . Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum . The fungus has been investigated for its ability to decolorize synthetic dyes that are used in the textile , plastics , biomedical and foodstuff industries . The dyes are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic .
