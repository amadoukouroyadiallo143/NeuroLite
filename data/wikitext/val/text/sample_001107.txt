 The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakefield . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to Sault Ste . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 .
