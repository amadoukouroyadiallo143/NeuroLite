 Olivia and Peter turn to an expert in progeria , Dr. Penrose ( Mark Blum ) , to trying to learn more about rapid aging , but Dr. Penrose cannot help them further , though Peter suspects he is hiding something . Unseen by the Fringe division , Dr. Penrose visits an abandoned warehouse and meets the murderer , Christopher ( Derek Cecil ) , his son , who suffers from rapid aging syndrome . Penrose warns Christopher to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process . By this time , Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion as Olivia 's serial murderer . At Walter 's lab , they identify the pituitary gland has been removed . They rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the glands to slow down his own aging process . Walter hypothesizes they can discover the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman 's optical nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative . Borrowing an electronic pulse camera from Massive Dynamic , they discover the image of a suspension bridge near Stoughton and identify the likely location from which it was viewed â€” the same warehouse that Dr. Penrose visited . The FBI converge on the building , and Olivia and Peter find Penrose about to cut into another victim . Olivia chases off after Christopher , who eventually succumbs to his rapid aging and dies , while Peter , after nicking Penrose with a bullet , confers with Walter to apply a makeshift defibrillator to bring the victim back to life .
