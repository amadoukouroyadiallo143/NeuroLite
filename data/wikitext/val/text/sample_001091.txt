 The highway continues parallel to the state line from the Marensico area through the national forest toward Watersmeet . That unincorporated community is the home of the Watersmeet High School Nimrods , the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel . The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the Ontonagon River , to Lake Michigan via the Brule and Menominee rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers . Also located in the area are the Sylvania Wilderness , and the Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation , which includes the Lac Vieux Desert Casino and Resort . The highway travels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County . US 2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 ( FFH 16 ) near Golden Lake in Stambaugh Township in the middle of the national forest . The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M ‑ 73 . In town , US 2 intersects M ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city .
