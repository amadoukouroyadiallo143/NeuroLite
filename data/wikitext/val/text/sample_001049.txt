 On July 17 , 2012 , Prague Municipal Court 's panel of three judges headed by judge Lubo≈° Vrba overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to CZK 8 million ( ~ US $ 400 @,@ 000 ) . After this , the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release , trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and / or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished . On August 2 , 2012 , the appellate court rejected the State Attorney 's second complaint and ordered Blythe 's immediate release . Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day , claiming in an interview with TV Nova that he would return for the trial .
