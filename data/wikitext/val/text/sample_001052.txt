 Both the defendant and the State Attorney may appeal the decision ; the appeal would be heard by a panel of the Prague High Court , consisting of three professional judges . A decision of second instance court is final and enforceable . Nevertheless , an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney , which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in Brno ; an extraordinary appeal may , however , rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case . After exhausting all of these remedies , the defendant may also lodge a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic . The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms .
