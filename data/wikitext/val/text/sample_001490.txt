 The open @-@ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations . Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send " a message of hope " and wish for a " world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " . With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , " I 'm not sure , really , about that . I used to think it was Belfast ...

But if you 're flip or throwaway about it , then you do . That 's one of the paradoxes I 've come to terms with . "
