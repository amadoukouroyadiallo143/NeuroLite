 The belligerents then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and sandbagged forts behind barbed wire defences . From 1951 until the end of the war , 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River . Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions . In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR . This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953 . The Australians fought their last battle during 24 â€“ 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a concerted Chinese attack along the Samichon River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded . Hostilities were suspended on 27 July 1953 . 17 @,@ 808 Australians served during the war , with 341 killed , 1 @,@ 216 wounded and 30 captured .
