 By the 7th century , there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700 . Even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style . Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I and his heir Yik 'in Chan K 'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal , extending as far as the territory around Lake Petén Itzá . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today .
