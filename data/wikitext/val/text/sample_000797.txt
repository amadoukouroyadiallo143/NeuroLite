 Descended from a prominent political family , Beckham was chosen as Democrat William Goebel 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . Goebel lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor , but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results . During the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot Goebel . A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to Goebel , who was sworn into office on his deathbed . Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and Beckham over the governorship . Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state .
