 Lyrically the song has excerpts of different languages including French , Spanish , Italian , Dutch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese . The song talks about personal empowerment and self @-@ sufficiency , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself . Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's " I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " Heart " ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it . The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album Disco Four . Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends .
