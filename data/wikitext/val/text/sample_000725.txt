 Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or Vereine in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology Kirche Deutschland e.V. Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz ( BfV , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years . However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members . Discrepancies in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . The number of contractually bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred .
