 The interchange , with its decorative etchings on precast concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( TxDOT ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the Cottonwood Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by TxDOT .
