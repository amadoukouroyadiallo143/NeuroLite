 US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and Ironwood , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River . The highway crosses the river into Gogebic County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . Running along Cloverland Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard . The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway . The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer . While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River . The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a stoplight in town . As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presque Isle River . US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco . This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway . At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake Gogebic .
