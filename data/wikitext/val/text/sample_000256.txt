 In 2006 , Billy Bragg reworked the song as " Bush War Blues " . Bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War . In one verse , Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to " make the world safe for Halliburton " . In another , he takes on the Christian right , asking where the moderates are . Finally , Bragg chides the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war .
