 Recent research shows that the Mongol forces most probably never reached Pagan . They were held at bay by the Burmese defenses led by commanders Athinkhaya , Yazathingyan and Thihathu , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan . ( An inscription dated 16 February 1293 by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the Mongol army . ) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the Mongol army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to Tagaung . They remained there as the treaty was now void .
