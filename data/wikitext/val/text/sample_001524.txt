 The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form . However , modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research . In particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance , directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step , and improving the overall stereoselectivity . These have been successful to varying degrees .
