" On release , Chris Welch wrote in Melody Maker : " A Number One hit could easily be in store for the maestro of rock drums .

" Woffinden described the single as " every bit as ebullient " as " It Don 't Come Easy " , although " slightly inferior " , while Mike DeGagne of AllMusic views it as a song where " [ t ] he jovial spirit of Ringo Starr shines through " . In a 1974 article for the NME , Charles Shaar Murray highlighted " Back Off Boogaloo " as a " great radio and juke @-@ box tune " .
