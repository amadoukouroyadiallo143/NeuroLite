 Several publications for manga , anime , video games , and other related media have commented on Shikamaru 's character . IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters in the series , and referred to him as " the poster child for any card @-@ carrying member of Generation X " due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness to utilize his potential . In a review of episode 110 , IGN praised how Shikamaru managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that the decision to make him Chunin was fair . Anime News Network also commented on this development , calling Shikamaru 's emergence as " an unlikely hero " one of the highlights of the arc . In a subsequent review of episode 135 , in which the mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru 's team were critically injured , IGN lauded the " great moment " in the episode in which Shikamaru began to cry after learning his friends will recover , and declared that he will be a better leader for the sake of his friends . Mania Entertainment 's Justin Rich celebrated his " sheer intellect " , calling him " one of the most fascinating characters in the series " and " one of the few truly brilliant fighters in sh≈çnen anime " . Dani Moure , another reviewer from the same site , noted about his battle with Temari during the Chunin Exams that it was " one of the better fights involving the supporting players " .
