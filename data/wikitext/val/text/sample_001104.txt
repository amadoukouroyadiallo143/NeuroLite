 The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the routings and designations of the highways around Cooks , Thompson and Manistique in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between Cooks and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 .
