 Additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the pentadienyl cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the oxyallyl cation " intercepted " in various ways . Furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed . The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below .
