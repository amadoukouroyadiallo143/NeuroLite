Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 during the middle of the year . Starting third , he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps , including the final 46 , to win the race by eight car @-@ lengths over Bill Elliott . In the middle of the race , Richmond 's car suffered gearbox problems . Because he could use only fourth ( high ) gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . Richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , " I had tears in my eyes when I took the checkered flag . Then every time anyone congratulated me , I started bawling again . " Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside , and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway 's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August , finishing 29th with a blown engine . He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987 .
