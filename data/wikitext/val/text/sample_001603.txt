 In February 2006 , Stork became the last perpetrator sentenced in the political assassination plot , after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors . Stork offered to turn herself in and return to the United States after learning of her son 's terminal brain tumor . Prior to sentencing , the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son . In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder , Stork also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law . An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years probation , and three months time already served in a German jail . Turner thought she should have received a harsher sentence , and commented " This was a lying @-@ in @-@ wait conspiracy to murder me , a presidential appointee , and for a long time I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed . " Though Stork could have faced life in prison , U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had " seen the error of her ways . " A federal prosecutor in the case described Stork as the " MVP " of the conspiracy , and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner . After her sentencing , Stork stated : " I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner , it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did . I 'm truly sorry . " Stork returned to Germany after her sentencing .
