 Blythe , who is nearsighted , took off his glasses before entering the stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half @-@ blind . Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage . One of the fans , who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers , and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings , managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security . Blythe testified that during the first attempt , Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving . The second time , he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to hug him . Blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught Pořádek 's collar , pushed him on the ground , knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop . He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off . It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back . Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security .
