 Following the season , Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the 2012 NBA Draft . A few days later , however , the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke 's stock was high led to some deliberation for him and his family : " When you have a season as a freshman like he did , the NBA , they like them young , " Trey 's father , Benji Burke said . " They think their ceiling is higher when they 're young . Trey had ... a solid season for a freshman . It 's going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years . " Some observers thought Burke was at his peak in terms of NBA potential . Eventually , he decided to return to play for Michigan for another year .
