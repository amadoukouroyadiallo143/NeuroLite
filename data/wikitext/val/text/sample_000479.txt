 Given his precarious position , Narathihapate decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the Mongols . In November / December 1285 , the king ordered his generals Ananda Pyissi and Maha Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . The Mongol commanders at Hanlin , who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named Zhengmian ( Chinese : 征緬 ; Wade – Giles : Cheng @-@ Mien ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . They repeated their 1281 demand that the Burmese king send a formal delegation to the emperor . The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March 1286 , which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire , and central Burma to be organized as the province of Mianzhong ( Chinese : 緬中 ; Wade – Giles : Mien @-@ Chung ) . After a long deliberation , the king agreed to submit but wanted the Mongol troops to withdraw . In June 1286 , he sent an embassy led by Shin Ditha Pamauk , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court .
