 Churchill 's Indians Are Us ? ( 1994 ) , a sequel to Fantasies of the Master Race , further explores American Indian issues in popular culture and politics . He examines the movie Black Robe , the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation killings , the prosecution of Leonard Peltier , sports mascots , the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 , and blood quantum laws , calling them tools of genocide . Churchill is particularly outspoken about New Age exploitations of shamanism and American Indian sacred traditions , and the " do @-@ it @-@ yourself Indianism " of certain contemporary authors . John P. LaVelle of the University of New Mexico School of Law published a review of Indians Are Us ? in The American Indian Quarterly . Professor LaVelle , an enrolled member of the Santee Sioux Nation , states that Indians Are Us ? twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes . It was in this book that Churchill first made the claim that the United States distributed " smallpox @-@ infested blankets " to Indian tribes , a claim which he repeated several times over the next decade . The claim has been criticized as a falsification . Churchill has , however , received support from some scholars .
