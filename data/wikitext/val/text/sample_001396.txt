 The traditional Simpsons opening sequence was replaced in this episode with a redesigned version that spoofed the opening sequence of the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones . The Game of Thrones opening shows the various locations featured in the series on a three @-@ dimensional map of the fictional continent Westeros . In the Simpsons opening , these locations were substituted with places in Springfield , and The Wall was replaced with the Simpson family 's couch . The theme song featured in the Game of Thrones opening sequence was arranged by The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen and used in the Simpsons opening as well . Nicholas McKaig , known for uploading a cappella covers of famous songs on YouTube , performed the Simpsons theme song over the closing credits of " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " . He was recruited after a staff member of the show saw his cover of the Simpsons theme on YouTube .
