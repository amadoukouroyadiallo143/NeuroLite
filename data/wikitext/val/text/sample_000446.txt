 The alignment of Route 29 between Ringoes and Somerville was eventually shifted to follow present @-@ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between Ringoes and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and Somerville . In 1938 , Route 29B was planned as an extension of Route 29A from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha . While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route 519 . In 1948 , a spur route , Route S29 , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in Lambertville to the New Hope @-@ Lambertville Bridge . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was redefined to continue north from Lambertville to Frenchtown on Route 29A , and the Route 29 designation between Lambertville and Newark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 between Lambertville and Somerville and U.S. Route 22 between Somerville and Newark . The section of former Route 29 between Route 29A and Route S29 became Route 165 .
