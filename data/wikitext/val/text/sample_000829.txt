 The idea for assembling a team of M훮ori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph Warbrick , a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in 1884 . He initially proposed a team of M훮ori or part @-@ M훮ori to play the touring British side in 1888 ; this developed into a venture to have a M훮ori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful . Hearing of Warbrick 's plans , civil servant Thomas Eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which Warbrick accepted . When James Scott , a publican , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that Warbrick would be the team 's captain , Scott its manager and Eyton its promoter .
