 During the second work @-@ in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double @-@ grooved boards with a metal tongue between them . The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued . The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted . The windshaft , the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint . A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diameter . A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar .
