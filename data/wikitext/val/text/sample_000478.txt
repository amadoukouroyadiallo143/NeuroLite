 The country fell into chaos . In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( Prome , Dala and Bassein ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at Hlegya , west of Prome . Without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . The governor of Pegu revolted that same year . The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed . Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( Pegu and Martaban ) was in open revolt .
