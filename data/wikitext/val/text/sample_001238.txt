 The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the Bolshevik party assumed power in October 1917 . Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ tsarist , anti @-@ Bolshevik White Russian forces . Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( NREF ) . Awaiting repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( NRRF ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed .
