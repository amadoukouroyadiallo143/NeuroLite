 The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records . He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score , and included two of the new themes created for The World Is Not Enough . The first , originally used as Renard 's theme , is heard during the mammoth " Antonov " cue on the recording , and is written for piano . The second new theme , used in the " Christmas in Turkey " track of The World Is Not Enough , is reused in the " Going Down Together " track .
