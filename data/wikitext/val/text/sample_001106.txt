 Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between Gould City and Epoufette in 1941 . The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to Naubinway and then along the lake to Epoufette . The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as Garnet . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was detoured around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II .
