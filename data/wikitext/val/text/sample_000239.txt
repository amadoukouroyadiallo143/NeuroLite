 Early on June 20 , convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C ( − 112 ° F ) ) appearing on satellite imagery . A notable increase in southerly outflow also took place . As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened , Beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track , bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico . Convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day . During the afternoon hours of June 20 , a hurricane hunter aircraft found Beatriz just below hurricane strength , and subsequently , the system was upgraded just a few hours later , while situated roughly 85 mi ( 140 km ) southeast of Manzanillo , Mexico . Early on June 21 , a 23 to 29 mi ( 37 to 47 km ) wide eye developed within the central dense overcast . In light of this , the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) ; however , it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch .
