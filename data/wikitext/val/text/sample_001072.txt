 On February 7 , 2013 , only one witness took the stand before the hearing was adjourned . Lukáš Havlena contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he " didn 't like the description of the situation " by the previous witnesses . He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show . He also said that each time somebody got on the stage , Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there . Havlena testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind . He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground . Havlena had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in Abaton , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the guardrail .
