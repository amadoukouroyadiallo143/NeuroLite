Fairey has said that The Simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its " blend of humor and social commentary " , and he felt " deeply honored " to be included in an episode . Fairey wrote on his website that " Part of being on The Simpsons , is you â€™ re being honored as a reference point in culture . " He described the plot of the episode as " great " , adding that the staff members of the show " were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed ( even though I had to make fun of myself to do so ) . " This was Fairey 's first acting performance . Street artists English , Scharf , and Conal also guest starred in the episode as themselves .
