 B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity , in Beswick , at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ; . It took its name from a quotation of British sprinter Linford Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the ' bang ' of the starting pistol , but at ' The B of the Bang ' . The artwork had been nicknamed KerPlunk by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s .
