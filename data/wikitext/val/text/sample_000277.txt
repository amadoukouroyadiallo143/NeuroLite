 The interchange is considered by Popular Mechanics to be one of " The World 's 18 Strangest Roadways " because of its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as " Public Works Projects of the Year " .
