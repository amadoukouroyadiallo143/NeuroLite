 In Menominee County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through the edge of the community of Hermansville before entering Powers . US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 . The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding on the south side of the CN Railway . At Harris , the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community . Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side . The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . East of Bark River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M â€‘ 69 . The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba .
