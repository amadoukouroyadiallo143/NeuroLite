 Radcliffe is a supporter of the Labour Party . Until 2012 Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats , and before the 2010 general election Radcliffe endorsed Nick Clegg , the Lib Dem leader . In 2012 , however , Radcliffe switched his allegiance to Labour , citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems in government , and approving of the Labour leader , Ed Miliband . In September 2015 , he endorsed Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 leadership contest to succeed Miliband . He is a supporter of a British republic . At the age of sixteen , Radcliffe became the youngest non @-@ royal ever to have an individual portrait in Britain 's National Portrait Gallery ( NPG ) . On 13 April 2006 his portrait , drawn by Stuart Pearson Wright , was unveiled as part of a new exhibition opening at the Royal National Theatre ; it was then moved to the NPG where it resides .
