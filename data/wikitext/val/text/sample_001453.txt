 " On the night before such an event neither Mamma , Pappa , or Daughter Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort . At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape . So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie . First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir ; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . Then arrived the guests . The Minister and the Mrs. Minister , they were , and some neighbors . While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring . Off she speeds to a decanter of whiskey in the kitchen . She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored . He , too , excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince . No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . She pours ' the right proportion ' in , too . "
