 Jablonský gained fame as attorney of Yekta Uzunoglu , a Kurdish national who was first charged in 1994 with preparing to commit three murders and committing blackmail and torture . It became one of the longest criminal cases in the Czech history , as the witnesses and alleged victims gradually withdrew or changed their testimonies against Uzunoglu until he was exonerated by the Municipal Court in Prague in 2007 . The court held that although the crimes did take place , there is no evidence that Uzunoglu took part in it . He was also defending judge Pavel Nagy , who was indicted of accepting a bribe . The proceedings ended with Nagy being found insane and criminally not liable . Jablonský also acted as a defense attorney in the case of a hairdresser of Czech VIPs indicted on charges of rape and torture . During the proceedings , the judge sent Jablonský to face the disciplinary commission of the Czech bar association for what he perceived as " behaviour bordering on contempt " .
