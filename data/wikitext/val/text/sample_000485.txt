 The uneasy arrangement would persist until 1297 . The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to Tagaung as the province of Zhengmian ( Cheng @-@ Mien ) but ended the fictional central Burma province of Mianzhong on 18 August 1290 . Meanwhile , the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers blatantly consolidating support . To check their rising power , Kyawswa submitted to the Mongols in January 1297 , and was recognized by the Yuan emperor Temür Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March 1297 . The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of Kyawswa . The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . On 17 December 1297 , the three brothers overthrew Kyawswa , and founded the Myinsaing Kingdom . The dethronement forced the Mongol government to intervene again , leading to the second Mongol invasion of Burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . The invasion failed . Two years later , on 4 April 1303 , the Mongols abolished the province of Zhengmian ( Cheng @-@ Mien ) , evacuated Tagaung , and returned to Yunnan .
