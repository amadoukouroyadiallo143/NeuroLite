 Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine . The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted . However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again . By the afternoon , the center of Josephine was only a swirl of clouds , devoid of convection . During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong southerly wind shear . By mid @-@ morning , Josephine re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection . However , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning . The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly .
