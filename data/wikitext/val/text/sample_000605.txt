 Although the new rulers of Tikal were foreign , their descendants were rapidly Mayanized . Tikal became the key ally and trading partner of Teotihuacan in the Maya lowlands . After being conquered by Teotihuacan , Tikal rapidly dominated the northern and eastern Peten . Uaxactun , together with smaller towns in the region , were absorbed into Tikal 's kingdom . Other sites , such as Bejucal and Motul de San José near Lake Petén Itzá became vassals of their more powerful neighbor to the north . By the middle of the 5th century Tikal had a core territory of at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in every direction .
