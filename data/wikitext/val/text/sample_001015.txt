 A port , Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis , was released for the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) on November 14 , 2006 in United States to mark the game 's fifteenth anniversary . It included several new features , such as the ability to save game progress , a level select option , and an Anniversary Mode with the Spin Dash move ( not originally implemented until Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ) . Its screen is slightly zoomed in , and adapted to the GBA 's widescreen aspect ratio . The game received poor reviews , with a Metacritic score of 33 percent ; the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance ( resulting in a slow frame rate ) , remixed chunky music , and poor preservation of the original gameplay .
