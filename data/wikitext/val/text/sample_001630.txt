 However , Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on gadgets and special effects , with the plot being neglected . James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said , " This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force @-@ feed James Bond into the mindless xXx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . " Of the action sequences , he said , " Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects . The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture . Coupled with lousy production design , Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap . Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as " the seemingly non @-@ stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string . " Roger Moore remarked , " I thought it just went too far – and that ’ s from me , the first Bond in space ! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage ? Please ! "
