 In January 1287 , the embassy arrived at Beijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor . The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . ( Indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . ) In exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . For the emperor , the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly . He did not want to invest more troops pacify the rest of the kingdom . He preferred a vassal ruler . The Burmese embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287 , and reported the terms to the king .
