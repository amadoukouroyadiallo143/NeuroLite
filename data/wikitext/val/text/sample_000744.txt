 A " sect filter " , also known as a " protective declaration " ( Schutzerkl√§rung ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . Such sect filters , primarily used to screen out Scientologists , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . " Sect commissioner 's " offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government .
