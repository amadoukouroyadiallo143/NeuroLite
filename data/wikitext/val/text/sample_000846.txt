 The team had two further matches before their international against England . The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England , Blackheath . Andrew Stoddart , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the Natives . The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by Keogh . Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players . The Natives were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 . The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy frost , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour .
