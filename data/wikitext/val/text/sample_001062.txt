 Nosek 's friend Jan Jebavý testified that Nosek climbed the stage , and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage . He said he was " 100 % sure Blythe pushed Nosek with both hands . " He further said that Blythe 's behavior deviated from all the concerts he had attended in the past , commenting that Blythe was visibly furious . He further claimed that Nosek was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe , with another fan being kicked , choked and receiving a punch from Blythe . Jebavý corroborated Blythe 's testimony that Blythe asked " Are you okay ? " after Nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply . However , as Nosek fell sick after the concert , they called him an ambulance . According to Jebavý , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it .
