" Farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character , stating " This guy thinks he 's God 's gift to women , God 's gift to intellect , to humor , to the club scene , to everything . It 's all part of his grandiose sense of self @-@ esteem , which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt , and all kinds of other things . With Pellit , Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible . " Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character , suggesting the comb over hairstyle , pot @-@ belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons .
