 The pair interview the cast and crew as suspects , discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths â€” producer Kenny Neiderman had been having an affair with Danbury ; Rowdy Beeman replaced Carroll as director ; Ruby Dahl and Ramona Tangent , whose roles in the film will expand without Danbury ; and Mark Bianco , a method actor relishing the opportunity to meet Black , whose role he plays . Also questioned is Hugo Winston , the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a disrespectful production .
