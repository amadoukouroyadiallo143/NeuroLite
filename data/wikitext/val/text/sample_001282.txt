 Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel . The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq . A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 .
