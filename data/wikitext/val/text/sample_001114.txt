 Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( GLCT ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near Ironwood to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( LSCT ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in Escanaba to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( LMCT ) . These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . " On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail .
