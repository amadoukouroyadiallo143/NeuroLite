 In late 1863 , the New Zealand government requested troops to assist in the invasion of the Waikato province against the Māori . Promised settlement on confiscated land , more than 2 @,@ 500 Australians ( over half of whom were from Victoria ) were recruited to form four Waikato Regiments . Other Australians became scouts in the Company of Forest Rangers . Despite experiencing arduous conditions the Australians were not heavily involved in battle , and were primarily used for patrolling and garrison duties . Australians were involved in actions at Matarikoriko , Pukekohe East , Titi Hill , Ōrākau and Te Ranga . Fewer than 20 were believed to have been killed in action . The conflict was over by 1864 , and the Waikato Regiments disbanded in 1867 . However , many of the soldiers who had chosen to claim farmland at the cessation of hostilities had drifted to the towns and cities by the end of the decade , while many others had returned to Australia .
