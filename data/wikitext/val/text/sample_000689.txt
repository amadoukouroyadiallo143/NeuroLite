 Burial 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of Siyaj Chan K 'awil . It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis . The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two adolescents who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler . The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king . The king 's skeleton was missing its skull , its femurs and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact .
