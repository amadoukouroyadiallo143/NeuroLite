 The fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill . At the end of the second work @-@ in , the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank . The fantail itself , with the blades painted red , white and blue was installed shortly afterwards . The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft . It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by Â½ inch ( 13 mm ) . When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1 / 16 th of an inch ( less than 1 mm ) of true . The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year . Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors , cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork . The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work @-@ in . The stock , with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock . The process was repeated for the second pair of sails . The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work @-@ in .
