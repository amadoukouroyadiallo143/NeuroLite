 On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That court , noting Hubbard 's instruction that Scientologists should " make money , make more money â€“ make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " Scientology purports to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " . In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses " inhuman and totalitarian practices " . Given the lessons of Germany 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . References in Scientology writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " antisocial " people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology 's utopian world " without insanity , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being classified as an " extremist political movement " .
