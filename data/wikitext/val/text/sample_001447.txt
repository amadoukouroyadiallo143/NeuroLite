 Samoa Joe and Booker T started a rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship following Slammiversary . On the June 12 episode of Impact ! , Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Kevin Nash . This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one @-@ on @-@ one match later in the broadcast . After this segment , Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July 13 for the title . On the July 10 episode of Impact ! , Sting proclaimed that he did not know which of the two would win at Victory Road , but that he would be there to watch . At the event , Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody , causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail . He was stopped when Sting interfered in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat . Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T 's legitimate wife Sharmell . The match result was ruled a no @-@ contest , with Joe retaining the title .
