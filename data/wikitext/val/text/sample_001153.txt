 Between the two work @-@ ins , the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed . This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work @-@ in . The boards for the cap are Â½ inch ( 13 mm ) thick and 9 inches ( 230 mm ) wide at the petticoat , tapering towards the top . A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft , not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit . When the boarding of the cap was completed , the cover strips were fitted over the joints . The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass , and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position , producing a sturdy structure . The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts . At the top of the mill tower , the curb was prepared to accept the cap , and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position . Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued , with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work @-@ in .
