 Burial 195 was flooded with mud in antiquity . This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely rotted away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving hollows in the dried mud . Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K 'awiil , the wooden originals long gone .
