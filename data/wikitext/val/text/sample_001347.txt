 On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the Investigative Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in " serious research misconduct " , including falsification , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions . The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . Churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University 's Privilege and Tenure Committee , which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offences . Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal .
