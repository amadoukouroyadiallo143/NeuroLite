 Structure 5D @-@ 43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza , built over a pre @-@ existing twin pyramid complex . It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways , the fourth ( south ) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side . The building has a talud @-@ tablero platform profile , modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan . In fact , it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself . The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols . Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels , related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan . The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain , showing a monstrous face , perhaps that of a jaguar , with another head emerging from the mouth . The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake . The temple , and its associated ballcourt , probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K 'awiil I , in the later part of the 7th century .
