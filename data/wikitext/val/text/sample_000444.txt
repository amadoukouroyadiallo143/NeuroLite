 Route 29 makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road , crossing into Kingwood Township , where the name of the road changes from Main Street to Daniel Bray Highway . Here , it intersects with County Route 651 ( Byram @-@ Kingwood Road ) . The route bends to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles , crossing into Frenchtown , where the route becomes Trenton Road . Upon entering Frenchtown , an end shield for northbound Route 29 is posted to mark the end of state maintenance , which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection , where maintenance is transferred to the county . Despite this , Route 29 officially continues farther north along Trenton Road to its northern terminus at Route 12 ( Bridge Street / Race Street ) , a short distance east of Route 12 â€™ s western terminus at the Uhlerstown @-@ Frenchtown Bridge . The southern terminus of County Route 513 is located a block north of the northern terminus of Route 29 along Route 12 .
