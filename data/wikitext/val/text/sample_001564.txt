 Filming of Horrible Bosses took place in and around Los Angeles . The production team attempted to find locations " that people haven 't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV " , aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America " where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss . " " Comnidyine " was represented by an office building in Torrance , California , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor . For " Pellitt Chemical " , the production team found a " perfect landscape of pipes and containers " in Santa Fe Springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility . To take advantage of the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series of overhauls , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new doorways to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland 's character . A T.G.I. Friday 's in Woodland Hills , Los Angeles , was used as a bar frequented by Nick , Dale , and Kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles .
