 James Caldwell , also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter , posted a review of the show in which he felt the main event was a " slow , plodding match " with an " anticlimactic finish . " Caldwell stated that the Styles versus Angle contest was a " fine spotlight singles match , " but was a " bit underwhelming when the expectations were reasonably high for two of TNA 's best wrestlers in a featured singles match . " He went on to say that he felt it was " missing something " and that it " seemed like the match just never moved out of second gear . Caldwell felt the X Division Championship bout was a " very good opening match , " which " could have been a featured match to sell a few additional PPV buys , but TNA didn 't give the X Division any focus until the final show before the PPV . " Caldwell stated the World Tag Team Championship was " just a slow , plodding tag match . " Regarding the marriage segment during the show , Caldwell said " it was just a bad , bad , bad segment that died slowly and painfully in front of the live audience . " Overall , Caldwell felt that " TNA showcased the X Division in the opening match , " but needed more " athleticism on the show to balance the slow , plodding former WWE heavyweight wrestlers in the main event slots .
