 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB . A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle Tours by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... " This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M ‑ 94 junction in Manistique , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan . Branches of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between Powers and Escanaba . The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan . The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I.
