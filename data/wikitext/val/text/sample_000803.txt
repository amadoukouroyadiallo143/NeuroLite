 Goebel lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor . When the General Assembly 's session opened on January 2 , 1900 , the election results were immediately challenged . With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed . The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30 , 1900 , when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . The following day , as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election . He was sworn into office from his bed the same day . Three days later Goebel died , never having risen from the bed .
