 For the single 's B @-@ side , Starr had already written and recorded " Blindman " , the theme song for the Ferdinando Baldi @-@ directed Spaghetti Western of the same name , filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh . Starr produced the track with Voormann . The sessions for " Blindman " took place at Apple on 18 â€“ 19 August , with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voormann . Like the film Blindman ( 1971 ) , the song is held in low regard by critics ; Spizer describes it as " a muddy @-@ sounding dirge with little to recommend " .
