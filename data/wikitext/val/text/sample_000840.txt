 Towers scored the first Welsh try , which was converted by Jim Webb . The Natives replied with a spirited run by Ellison , but he failed to break through the Welsh defence . The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half @-@ way line , which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd . Webb , playing in out of position at full @-@ back , missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark . The Natives continued to push , with Elliot coming within five @-@ yards of the try line , and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25 @-@ yard line before he could touch down . In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives ' 25 ; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls , who managed to get the ball across the try line , allowing Jim Hannan to score . Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries , but there were no further scores in the game .
