 " Sewn together , joining heads . Just a matter of time ' til you rip yourselves apart " , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation Mengele stitched together twins , one of them deformed ; " the hunchback was sewn to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . " This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor Vera Alexander at the 1961 trial of SS @-@ Hauptscharf√ºhrer Adolf Eichmann the " architect of the Holocaust " , where it was asserted that Mengele " sewed the veins together " and turned " them into Siamese twins . " This allegation became more widely known when Vera Alexander was featured in the 1985 documentary The Search for Mengele , which has been cited by several authors including Gerald Posner , an expert on Mengele .
