 New oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower . The bin floor was removed , apart from one oak main beam which was repairable . A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine , and the oak beam was repaired . New oak joists were fitted , along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused . One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail . Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump , which , following its collapse on 19 February 1977 , had been re @-@ erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life , Stowmarket . The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair , brickwork was repaired , and new lintels were made for some of the windows . A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter . The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed .
