 Ma Anand Sheela served 29 months in a minimum security federal prison for charges related to assault , attempted murder , arson , wiretapping and the 1984 bioterror attack in The Dalles , and moved to Switzerland after her release from prison in 1988 . The assassination conspiracy was discovered after Sheela had left the United States , and as of 1999 she was still wanted by federal law enforcement for her role in the plot , and risked extradition if she crossed the Swiss border . Switzerland declined an extradition request from the United States , and instead tried her in a Swiss court . Sheela was found guilty of " criminal acts preparatory to the commission of murder " in 1999 , and sentenced to time already served .
