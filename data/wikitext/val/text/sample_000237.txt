 Hurricane Beatriz was a Category 1 hurricane that killed four people after brushing the western coast of Mexico in June 2011 . Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June 19 , several hundred miles south of Mexico , Beatriz gradually intensified . Gaining latitude , the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status on the evening of June 20 . The following morning , Beatriz attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) as it passed roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) of Mexico . Due to its interaction with land , the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later . Early on June 22 , Beatriz dissipated over open waters . Prior to Beatriz 's arrival in Mexico , hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas . Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero . Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in Acapulco , killing four people . However , the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe drought .
