 Bobby 's environments were designed with more contrast , the character being new to the work area . Frankel described the contrast as " the company reflects [ Jack Pellitt 's ] human touch , whereas [ Bobby Pellitt 's ] home is a shameless shrine to himself and his hedonistic appetites . " Frankel continued , " It features a mishmash of anything he finds exotic and erotic , mostly Egyptian and Asian motifs with an ' 80s Studio 54 vibe , a makeshift dojo , lots of mirrors and a massage table . " Some parts of the house design were provided by Farrell and Gordon 's interpretation of the character and his " infatuation " with martial arts and " his delusions of prowess " .
