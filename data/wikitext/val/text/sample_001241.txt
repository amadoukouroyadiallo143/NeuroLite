 In October 1927 , HMAS Adelaide was called to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by Kwaio natives at Sinalagu on the island of Malaita on 3 October , known as the Malaita massacre . Arriving at Tulagi on 14 October , the ship proceeded to Malaita to protect the landing of three platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the killers . The ship 's personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support . Adelaide returned to Australia on 23 November .
