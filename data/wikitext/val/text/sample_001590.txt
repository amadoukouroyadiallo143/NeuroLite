 After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland , Oregon . They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner . Rajneesh follower Carol Matthews ( Ma Prem Samadhi ) used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner . According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college yearbook of Turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location . Court records state that Matthews and an unindicted co @-@ conspirator gave voter registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting " a voter survey on President Reagan 's economic plan " , in order to obtain Turner 's route number and post office box number . The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service , but the postal officials did not give them Turner 's address . They then drove around Turner 's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said " Turner " . Matthews had pictures of Turner 's residence developed ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) during an investigation of the Rajneesh commune , and verified after being shown to Turner .
