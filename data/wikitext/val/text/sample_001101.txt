 One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well . In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste . Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail . The routings varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste . Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway name .
