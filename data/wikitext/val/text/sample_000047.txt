 Masashi Kishimoto has noted that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius , and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha 's intelligent but abrasive personality . Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru if he were a girl , noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life . When designing Shikamaru 's Part II appearance , Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series . As a result , he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair .
