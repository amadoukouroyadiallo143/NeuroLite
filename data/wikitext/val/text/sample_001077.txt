 A Nosek family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible . He continued that he would not be substantiating the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered . He further added that Daniel had died on his father 's birthday , and his mother has consequently become a psychiatry patient unable to work .
