 The fruit bodies of Mycena inclinata grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut ) during the spring and autumn . The fungus forms a white , woolly mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves . Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York .
