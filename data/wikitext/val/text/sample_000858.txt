 The response from the team 's management was to suspend four players . The team travelled to Toowoomba , where they defeated the locals 19 â€“ 0 . The Natives included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles Speakman , after the suspensions reduced the playing strength of the side . The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in Invercargill on 5 August .
