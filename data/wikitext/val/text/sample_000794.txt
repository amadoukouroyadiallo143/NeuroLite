 " Training Day " received mixed reviews from television critics . IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo was not given a proper introduction and that he wasn 't distinguished from Michael 's character . She also went on to criticize Jim , Pam and Dwight 's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager , particular that of Jim and Pam , writing that " it 's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don 't know what to do with them anymore " . However , she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season 's improvement over the sixth , and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season . She ultimately gave the episode a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 rating , denoting a " good " episode . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised Michael 's reactions to the office easily ignoring him for Deangelo , calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone " quite effective " , and that Dwight 's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael 's replacement made it more " meaningful " . Despite this , he continued by saying that the series was not " sophisticated " enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast , which made them look " stupid " for " cheap humor " and a " enormously shallow laughter " . He ultimately gave the episode a " C + " . Alan Sepinwall , a columnist for HitFix , complimented the chemistry between Ferrell and Carell , but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael " being petulant about not being the center of attention every minute of every day " , negatively comparing it to " Viewing Party " . Despite this , he noted that Ferrell 's presence did involve several funny moments .
