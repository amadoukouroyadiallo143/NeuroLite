 Tropical Storm Josephine was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . Josephine developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 . The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 . The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm Josephine around noon the same day . Over the next several days , Josephine moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 . Strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused Josephine to weaken into a tropical depression . Josephine deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of Guadeloupe on September 10 . However , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix .
