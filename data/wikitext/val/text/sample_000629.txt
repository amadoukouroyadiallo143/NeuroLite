 By the Late Classic , a network of sacbeob ( causeways ) linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core . These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the Temple of the Inscriptions ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the southeast ) . These broad causeways were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler , Maudslay , Tozzer and MÃ©ndez causeways . They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams .
