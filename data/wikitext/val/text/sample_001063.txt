 Nosek 's other friend Ond≈ôej Vlach testified that Nosek 's fall happened in a break between the end of concert and the encore . Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage . According to him , Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off . While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage , Nosek fell directly on the ground . According to Vlach , there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break . Vlach further testified that after the fall , Nosek went to sit on a bench , where he was fetched a water bottle . Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the back of his head , they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion . Vlach said that he understood Blythe 's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage .
