 According to Blythe 's attorney Martin Radvan , the police launched an investigation following the death of Nosek , about a month after the concert and following a coma . After interviewing several eyewitnesses from the concert , the police asked the United States Department of Justice to take part in the investigation ; however , they refused to cooperate and , moreover , did not notify anyone from Lamb of God or its management .
