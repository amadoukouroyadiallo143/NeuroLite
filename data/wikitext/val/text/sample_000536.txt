 The portion of current Route 50 between Seaville and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway . In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to Egg Harbor City . Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing this portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 . In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in Mullica Township . This proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in June 2010 .
