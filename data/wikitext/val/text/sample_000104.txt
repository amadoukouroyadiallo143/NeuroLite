 Early on , the economy depended greatly upon the railroads in the area . The city was the largest in Mississippi around the start of the 20th century , with five major rail lines and 44 trains coming in and out daily . The city 's economy not only depended on the rails but the goods , such as timber and cotton , transported on them . With these rail @-@ based industries , the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930 . Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s , the city has adapted , moving from a largely rail @-@ based economy to a more diversified one , with healthcare , military , and manufacturing employing the most people .
