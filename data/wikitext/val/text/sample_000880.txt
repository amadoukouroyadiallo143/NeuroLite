 Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America . Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik Satie and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert . She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg . Through this , Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States . She also included American music in all of her concerts . Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 . She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics .
