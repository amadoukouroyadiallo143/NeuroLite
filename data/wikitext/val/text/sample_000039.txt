 M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between Fremont and Howard City . The section between Newaygo and Howard City travels through Fremont and along the southern edge of Manistee National Forest . The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 . The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s . Various extensions and truncations have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or Hesperia in the past . The current route was finalized in the late 1970s
