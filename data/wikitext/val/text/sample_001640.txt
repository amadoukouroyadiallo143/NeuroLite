 From 7 February 2006 to 9 December 2008 , Ayola starred in BBC medical drama Holby City as nurse Kyla Tyson . She had previously appeared in Holby City 's sister show Casualty , and had made an appearance in Holby City 's fifth series as patient Marianne Lawson . She was approached about returning to the show in a more permanent role by BBC casting director Julie Harkin . After a series of three meetings , a year after the birth of her first child , she agreed to assume the role of Kyla , despite being " nervous about signing such a long contract " , stating : " I 've been someone who 's loved the uncertainty of acting . I 've loved that one month it 's Sahara in Morocco and the next I 'm doing a stage play , then it 's a six @-@ part telly thing . But last summer I started thinking it would be really nice not to have to look for a job every couple of weeks . It would be nice just to stay put for a while . If I 'm going to be a working mum I 'd rather just be one rather than be one intermittently . And then Holby came along , so I 'm very grateful " .
