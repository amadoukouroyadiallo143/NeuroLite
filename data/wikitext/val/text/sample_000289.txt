 To save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . However , Zachry decided to use precast concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by Deal S.R.L. of Italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place .
