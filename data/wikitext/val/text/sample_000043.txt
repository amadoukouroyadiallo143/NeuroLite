 The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , Hesperia and Fremont , replacing M @-@ 41 . In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing . This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , shortening M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in Newaygo . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 . Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby .
