 Randy Blythe was called again to the stand that day . The judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions . The judge went again through the Blythe 's testimony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan Pořádek whom Blythe threw off the stage . Blythe responded by saying : " To the best of my knowledge , it was Milan Pořádek who was coming up [ on stage ] every time . "
