 Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter reviewed the show . He felt the main event had " lots of action and drama , " but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a " particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner " than " beating someone to win a fight . " Keller said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a " solid tag match " with some " elaborate sequences " that were " well executed . " Keller stated that the X Division Championship match was a " very good opener . " Regarding the Styles and Angle bout , Keller commented that it was a " good match , but short of a classic must @-@ see match in part because there were too many chinlocks mid @-@ match from Angle that took the crowd out of it .
