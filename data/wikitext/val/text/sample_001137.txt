 The mill was worked by Stephen Peverett , Richard 's son . He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879 . In 1884 , the mill was sold by auction , and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold . Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill . From 1892 , a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power , driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor . This was replaced in 1914 by a Hornsby oil engine . Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent , a retired millwright from Garboldisham , Norfolk . The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s . The mill was tailwinded c1920 , and as a result one pair of sails was removed . Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924 . One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded .
