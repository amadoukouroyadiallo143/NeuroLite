 Democrat William Goebel chose Beckham as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 . Goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and Beckham 's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate . But friends of Goebel assured him that Beckham would be loyal to Goebel 's reform agenda , whereas the two other men Goebel was considering as running mates would " stack the Senate committees against him . " Beckham was not yet 30 , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection .
