 Designing Julia 's office was described as a " challenge " , infusing a " sensual vibe " into a dental office . Frankel approached the design through Julia 's mentality , stating , " She 's a Type A professional at the top of her game , who likes to play cat @-@ and @-@ mouse , so it 's a completely controlled environment , with apertures and views into other rooms so she always knows what 's going on " . " It 's highly designed , with rich wallpaper and tones , sumptuous artwork and subtle lighting â€” all very disarming till you step into her private office . The blinds close , the door locks and you think , ' It 's the Temple of Doom . ' " Similarly approaching the character 's home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street " which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn 't get away with at work . "
