 Shortly before the third leg of the Elevation Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band 's first show in New York City following the attacks , the band performed " Where the Streets Have No Name " , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans . The experience was one inspiration for the song " City of Blinding Lights " . The band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show on 3 February 2002 . The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band . U2 's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrated 's list of " Top 10 Super Bowl Halftime Shows " .
