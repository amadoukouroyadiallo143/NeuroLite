Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down , knelt on him and held him down for a moment , but Blythe definitely did not choke him . He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( Pořádek ) was drunk and the way he acted , Blythe 's reaction was adequate . He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage .
