 Gauthier travelled to France , where she received private voice lessons from Auguste @-@ Jean Dubulle of the Paris Conservatory . Nodules on her vocal cords were problematic , but they were removed surgically . She later began training under Jacques Bouhy , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique . In 1906 , Gauthier was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degree of mentorship to Gauthier during the 30 week tour of Canada .
