 Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and Lambertville ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton â€™ s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175 .
