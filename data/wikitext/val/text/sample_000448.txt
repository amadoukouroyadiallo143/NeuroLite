 Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township . A two @-@ lane street , Lamberton Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville @-@ Trenton Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 . A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 .
