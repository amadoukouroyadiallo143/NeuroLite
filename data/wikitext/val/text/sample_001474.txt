 Starr recorded a new version of " Back Off Boogaloo " for his 1981 album on Boardwalk Records , Stop and Smell the Roses . The song was produced by Starr 's friend , singer Harry Nilsson , and features a musical arrangement by Van Dyke Parks . Similar to Nilsson 's 1968 cover of the Beatles ' " You Can 't Do That " , the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band 's songs â€“ in this case , " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Help ! " , " Lady Madonna " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " , as well as Starr 's " It Don 't Come Easy " . In a further reference to his past , the 1981 version of " Back Off Boogaloo " opens with the same guitar riff that Harrison had played on " It Don 't Come Easy " ten years before .
