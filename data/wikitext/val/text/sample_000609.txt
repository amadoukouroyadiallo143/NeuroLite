 The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " Lady of Tikal " , who was very likely a daughter of Chak Tok Ich 'aak II . She seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers . The first of these was Kaloomte ' B 'alam , who seems to have had a long career as a general at Tikal before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence . The Lady of Tikal herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering . It appears she was later paired with lord " Bird Claw " , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler . .
