 During a concert on May 24 , 2010 , in the Prague club , Abaton , Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel Nosek , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old attending fan . According to eyewitness statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper aktuálně.cz following Blythe 's arrest , Blythe was chanting " Come on up " between songs , which , the newspaper stated , may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans . The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage , falling backwards directly on his head . According to the same paper , Nosek was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol , suffered serious brain trauma , fell into a coma , and died weeks later from his injuries .
