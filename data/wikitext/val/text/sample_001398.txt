 Writing for The A.V. Club , television reviewer Hayden Childs commented that " Exit Through the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart " was " somewhat amusing and far more coherent than many recent episodes , but the satire is relatively mild . The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending , but it is otherwise solid enough . " Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones . Tim Surette of TV.com called it " one minute of genius " , and MTV 's Brandon Freeberg wrote : " Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this one out of the park . " Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend , both fans of Game of Thrones , named the opening the best in the history of the show . IGN 's Eric Goldman commented : " Ah , The Simpsons . Always there for us with clever / loving parody of something we all love . Such was the case last night , when the animated series opened with an epic opening credit sequence that gave us the Springfield @-@ inspired version of the terrific Game of Thrones credits . "
