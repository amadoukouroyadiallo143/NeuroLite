Stuckle of the Hayden Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 . The easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in mountaineering parlance . Mount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains .
