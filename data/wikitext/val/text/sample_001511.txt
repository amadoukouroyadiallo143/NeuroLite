 The success of the Nazarov cyclization as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products ( including jasmone , the aflatoxins , and a subclass of prostaglandins ) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis . The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published .
