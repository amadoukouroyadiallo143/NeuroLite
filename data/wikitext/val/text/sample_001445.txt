 After Slammiversary ended , crews began to disassemble the set used for the event . During this time , a man named Kevin " Angus " Sinex was removing a light array when the scaffolding he was positioned on collapsed , causing him to slam against the concrete floor below . He was rushed to the Baptist DeSoto Hospital in Southaven , Mississippi where he was pronounced deceased . Another worker named Paul Martin was also taken to the hospital due to his thumb being cut off in the incident . TNA released a statement regarding the incident the next day through their website . The June 12 episode of Impact ! was dedicated to Sinex , with a banner at the beginning of the show stating " In memory Kevin Sinex ( 1963 â€“ 2008 ) " . A moment of silence was held prior to the Impact ! tapings after Slammiversary in honor of Sinex .
