 Oxford were pre @-@ race favourites , but Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . Oxford took an early lead , but the boats closed on each other , and Umpire John Garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both coxes in an attempt to prevent a collision . By Craven Cottage , Oxford were nearly a length ahead and Cambridge responded ; by the time the crews passed under Hammersmith Bridge they were level . Along Chiswick Eyot Oxford moved ahead once again , and were clear of Cambridge after 30 strokes . Oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in 20 minutes 53 seconds , six lengths and 22 seconds ahead of their opponents . Driving rain , strong winds and choppy water resulted in the slowest winning time for over sixty years , but the largest margin of victory since the 2004 race .
