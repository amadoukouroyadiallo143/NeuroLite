 The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain . In the north of England , criticism of the visitors ' sportsmanship was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the Natives , including Joe Warbrick , accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players .
