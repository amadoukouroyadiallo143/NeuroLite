 The freeway portion of Route 29 ends at the intersection with Lee Avenue and it continues northwest along the Delaware River as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The route meets the southern terminus of County Route 579 ( Sullivan Way ) . The median widens again and then narrows as the route meets the southern terminus of Route 175 , a former alignment of Route 29 that currently serves as a frontage road . Route 29 crosses into Ewing Township and becomes the Daniel Bray Highway . It passes under the West Trenton Railroad Bridge , which carries CSX and SEPTA â€™ s West Trenton Line over the Delaware River . Route 29 intersects Route 175 again and then comes to a complex interchange with Interstate 95 , with the ramps within the median of Route 29 , just to the east of the Scudder Falls Bridge .
