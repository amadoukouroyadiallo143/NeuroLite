 Richmond grew up in Ashland , Ohio . His parents , Al and Evelyn ( n√©e Warner ) Richmond , met in the course of their work . Al was a welder for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager . Noticing that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe , Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . To market this invention , he founded Richmond Manufacturing , which eventually exported machines worldwide .
