 By the 2000s , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .
