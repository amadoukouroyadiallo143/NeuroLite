 While Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam , he loves the antics of Andy , who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat , getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and ( at Deangelo 's urging ) eats soap ; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that " this is my life now " . Deangelo 's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches , despite Deangelo 's peanut allergy . Deangelo then assembles the staff in the " multipurpose room " , including Dwight , who learned from Gabe that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael . Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office . Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting , saying that he 's a good manager and Dunder Mifflin won 't be the same without him . The two make up with a reverse hug , Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement . Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room .
