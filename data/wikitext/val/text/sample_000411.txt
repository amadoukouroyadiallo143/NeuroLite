 After voicing a character in an episode of the animated television series The Simpsons in late 2010 , Radcliffe debuted as J. Pierrepont Finch in the 2011 Broadway revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , a role previously held by Broadway veterans Robert Morse and Matthew Broderick . Other cast members included John Larroquette , Rose Hemingway and Mary Faber . Both the actor and production received favourable reviews , with USA Today commenting : " Radcliffe ultimately succeeds not by overshadowing his fellow cast members , but by working in conscientious harmony with them â€“ and having a blast in the process . " Radcliffe 's performance in the show earned him Drama Desk Award , Drama League Award and Outer Critics Circle Award nominations . The production itself later received nine Tony Award nominations . Radcliffe left the show on 1 January 2012 .
