 The song was also used as a video backdrop during the interlude between the bedouin and the glam / rock sections . The video featured images of fascists and political leaders from past and present like Adolf Hitler and Idi Amin Dada to George W. Bush and Tony Blair . Their images flashed across the screen , with text and footage of war atrocities intermingled in between . Madonna appears on the screens wearing her " Sorry " video leotard and utters the words " talk is cheap " and " don 't speak " , along with the music and Bush 's lips stuttering . The performances of " Sorry " and the remix video was included in The Confessions Tour CD and DVD .
