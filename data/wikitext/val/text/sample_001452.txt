 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24 , 1910 . It states : " Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome , and were it not for the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . So the time honored get @-@ togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . The Gales thought well of this established feature . They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests . They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . "
