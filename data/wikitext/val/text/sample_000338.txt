Camping , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . The only developed recreation site nearby is at Willow Creek Hot Springs , just south of the Whitehorse Ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles . Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , pronghorn , chukars , and rabbits . Fishing on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis . The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @-@ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek bottoms . There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by Northern Paiute people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago .
