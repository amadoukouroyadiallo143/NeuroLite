 The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown Escanaba . A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and Sault Ste . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to Cedarville and north to Sault Ste . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934 . Downtown Ironwood was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 .
