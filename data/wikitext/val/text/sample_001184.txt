 The scene where SpongeBob and Patrick playing a game of Eels and Escalators , which is a parody of Snakes and Ladders , was difficult for the crew to animate , since many shots featured certain board pieces changing location . According to the series ' season 2 DVD commentary , it was planned to have a scene that had SpongeBob saying " Go ' dolphin noise ' yourself " followed by Patrick saying " ' Dolphin noise ' you too ! " during the Eels and Escalators game . It was removed in the final episode check because it would have been inappropriate for the younger audience .
