 Mycena inclinata is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : cellulose , hemicellulose and lignin .
