 " I really love Holby and I 'm surprised how much . What thrills me about Holby is that you get back what you put in . The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job . For me it 's about more than turning up and saying the lines . It 's about understanding it and trying to make it better . That 's actually a lot of fun . What 's great is nobody says , ' Just shut up . ' They want you to work at it . [ ... ] I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think , ' do I want to do something else ? ' but I really like this job , I never get that awful ‘ dread ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work . "
