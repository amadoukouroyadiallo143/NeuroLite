 Churchill has been a leader of Colorado AIM 's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its associated parade . Colorado AIM 's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community , the main supporters of the parade . As early as 2004 , Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the Ninth Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , overriding the First Amendment rights of non @-@ Native Americans .
