 The silicon @-@ directed Nazarov cyclization reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product Silphinene , shown below . The cyclization takes place before elimination of the benzyl alcohol moiety , so that the resulting stereochemistry of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the silyl alkene anti to the ether .
