 For the PopMart Tour of 1997 â€“ 1998 , U2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour . The set 's massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an " astonishing , 2001 @-@ style trip into the heart of a swirling , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal monolith " . Near the end of the song , peace doves were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards . Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a " UFO landing site " .
