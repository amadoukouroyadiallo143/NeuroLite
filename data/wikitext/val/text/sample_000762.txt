 In 2003 , Joachim Güntner , writing in the Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung , noted that Gerhard Besier , a German Christian theologian , director of the Hannah Arendt Institute for Research into Totalitarianism in Dresden and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Lund University , Sweden , for his championing of religious freedom , had been pressured to forego publication of his scientific study of Scientology after having found himself the subject of widespread criticism in the German media for advocating a more tolerant attitude towards Scientology . Güntner concluded that " alarmism " had " triumphed " over science and noted an apparent lack of confidence in Germany 's ability to engage in open public discourse on the matter .
