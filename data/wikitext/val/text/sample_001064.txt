 Another person to testify was Robert Havelka , who worked as a security guard the night of the incident . Havelka said that the guardrail was too close to the stage , but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage . He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured . He further said that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely .
