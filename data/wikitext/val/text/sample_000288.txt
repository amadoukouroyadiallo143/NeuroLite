 Zachry Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by TxDOT , the largest ever by that agency . The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time TxDOT had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a sliding scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . Also built into the construction contract was a provision that Zachry was charged for " lane rentals " by TxDOT for time they closed down traffic lanes â€” fees based on hourly assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours . In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and viaducts so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished .
