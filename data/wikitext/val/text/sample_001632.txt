 Speculation arose in 2003 of a spin @-@ off film concentrating on Jinx , which was scheduled for a November / December 2004 release . It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a " winter olympics " alternative to ' James Bond ' . In the late 1990s , MGM had originally considered developing a spin @-@ off film based on Michelle Yeoh 's character , Wai Lin , in 1997 's Tomorrow Never Dies . However , despite much speculation of an imminent movie , on 26 October 2003 , Variety reported that MGM had completely pulled the plug on this project , to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of Eon Entertainment , who were reported to be " clearly furious " about the decision . MGM were keen to instead move on with the next film , Casino Royale .
