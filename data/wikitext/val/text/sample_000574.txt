 Rhodesia then attacked ZIPRA 's bases in Zambia , in what Group Captain Peter Petter @-@ Bowyer later described as " payback time " for Flight 825 . Operation Gatling , launched on 19 October 1978 , was another joint @-@ force operation between the Air Force and the Army , which contributed Special Air Service and Rhodesian Light Infantry paratroopers . Gatling 's primary target , just 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) north @-@ east of central Lusaka , was the formerly white @-@ owned Westlands Farm , which had been transformed into ZIPRA 's main headquarters and training base under the name " Freedom Camp " . ZIPRA presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka . About 4 @,@ 000 guerrillas underwent training at Freedom Camp , with senior ZIPRA staff also on site . The Rhodesian operation 's other targets were Chikumbi , 19 kilometres ( 12 miles ) north of Lusaka , and Mkushi Camp ; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia . Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces ; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked .
