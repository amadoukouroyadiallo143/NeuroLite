 After the work @-@ ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift @-@ on in October . The weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern microporous paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof , was completed in time for the lift @-@ on . A mini work @-@ in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend . Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled . The 5 @-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people . The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery , Southwold .
