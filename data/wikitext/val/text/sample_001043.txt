 Following Blythe 's arrest , Tomáš Fiala , a promoter of the concert , said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe , and that " it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be . " According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR , " [ the ] incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the barricade and rushed Randy during the performance . It is alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head . " However , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than Nosek . Guitarist Willie Adler said , " I can 't recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage . I think I would 've noticed something like that considering the Dime thing . "
