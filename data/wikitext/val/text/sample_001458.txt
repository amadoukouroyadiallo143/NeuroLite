 The title for the song was inspired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc Bolan . Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . " Back Off Boogaloo " demonstrates the influence of glam rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about Bolan 's band T. Rex around this time . Described by one author as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus Voormann .
