 The United States media , while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany . Richard Cohen for example , writing in the Washington Post , said in 1996 : " Scientology might be one weird religion , but the German reaction to it is weirder still – not to mention disturbing . " Alan Cowell , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials ' fear that Scientology " was a totalitarian movement growing , like the Nazi party , from inconsequential beginnings " – was itself redolent of " the Nazi era 's authoritarianism " .
