 The accompanying music video , directed by Madonna 's choreographer Jamie King , was a continuation from the " Hung Up " music video . It featured Madonna and her dancers roaming around a city in a van , dancing on roller skates and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage . She performed the song on her 2006 Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video . An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song , which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction .
