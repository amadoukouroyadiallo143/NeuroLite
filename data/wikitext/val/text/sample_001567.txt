 Lennertz recorded the soundtrack at The Village recording studio in West Los Angeles and Capitol Records . Lennertz attempted to remain " authentic " to the characters ' progression from average worker to calculated killer . To achieve this aim , he decided against recording digitally , instead recording the tracks on two @-@ inch analog tape , intending each musical cue to sound as if it was emanating from a vinyl record . He explained , " The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album . It isn 't over @-@ produced or shiny and digital in any way . It 's brash , noisy , and full of bravado and swagger . I knew that if we could harness some of this sonic magic in the score , then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman , Sudeikis , and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire . " Lennertz continued , " We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound , and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection . We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck 's classic ‘ Where It 's At ’ . At the end of the day , Seth [ Gordon ] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself . I think we did it ... and most of all , everyone had a blast in the process . "
