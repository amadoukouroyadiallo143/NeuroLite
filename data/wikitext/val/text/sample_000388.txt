 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . In the case of Upsilon Andromedae b , this lower limit is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 Â° and the true mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . Coplanarity is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees .
