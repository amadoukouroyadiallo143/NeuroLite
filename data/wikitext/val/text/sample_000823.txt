 Beckham attempted to return to the Senate in 1936 . The head of the Jockey Club , James B. Brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 . In 1933 Beckham 's ally , Robert Bingham , had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , increasing his prominence and influence . Beckham also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller . The race was complicated , though , by the entry of John Y. Brown , a Democrat who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives . He had agreed to support Chandler 's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler 's support in his run for the Senate . However , Chandler threw his support to Beckham , and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most of them at Beckham 's expense . Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes .
