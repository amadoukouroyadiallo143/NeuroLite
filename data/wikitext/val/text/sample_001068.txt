 The judge also read a sworn statement from Abaton 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident . She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation . The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) from the stage . Promoter Tomáš Fiala testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert .
