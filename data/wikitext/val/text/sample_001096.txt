 The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone . The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no driveway access . Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the ELS Railroad south of the stoplight for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest . The expressway continues north parallel to the CN Railway , crossing the Days River . Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic . This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de Noc before ending at Rapid River . In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the Rapid and Whitefish rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the Hiawatha National Forest . Near Garden Corners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de Noc . After the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County .
