 The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped curtains . Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour , Trey Lorenz , Melodie Daniels and Kelly Price . As the introduction began with " Emotions " , each of the curtains were slowly draped , revealing Carey atop the platform , dressed in a beige mini @-@ dress and matching sheer blouse and stiletto heels . As she began performing " Emotions " , the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song 's performance . After an intimate performance with dimmed lights for " The Roof ( Back in Time ) " , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by a Peruvian guitar player , who played the Latin @-@ inspired guitar melodies during her performance of " My All " . Afterwards , Carey sang " Close My Eyes " , the only sitting performance of the show . During the song , several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage .
