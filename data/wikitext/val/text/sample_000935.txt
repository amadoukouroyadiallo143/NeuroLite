 The three Hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye Tingxiu , which was called simply the Discussion of Poetry ( Shi Tan , 詩譚 ) ( 1635 ) . Other works on poetry from the studio included Helpful Principles to the Subtle Workings of Selected Tang Poems ( Leixuan Tang Shi Zhudao Weiji , 類選唐詩助道微機 ) , which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included colophons by Hu Zhengyan himself .
