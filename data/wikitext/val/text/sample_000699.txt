 The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong southerly shear . Josephine became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status . Josephine regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . Due to the lack of convection , Josephine was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at 11p.m. ( EDT ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm regenerating over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . The next morning , Josephine was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with Josephine as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated .
