 The side left Christchurch and travelled north where they played Wairarapa in Masterton . The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated . The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the Natives all profit from the match . After this the Natives travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August . The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the Aucklanders kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion . The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the Natives had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over Widnes on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats .
