 Upon the release of The Joshua Tree , critics praised " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Steve Morse of The Boston Globe noted the " bell @-@ like tones from the Edge fram [ e ] a search for heaven " and along with the subsequent track on the album , " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " . The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest . Rolling Stone called it " assertive rock " in their review of The Joshua Tree . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said of " Where the Streets Have No Name " , " the music charges , like someone fleeing for life " . The Washington Post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in Bono 's resolute delivery , Dave ( the Edge ) Evan 's quavering guitar , Adam Clayton 's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen 's rolling thunder drums " .
