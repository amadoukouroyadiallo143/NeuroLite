 Indictment against Blythe was brought by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík . Mužík had tried a number of murderers , such as Luboš Mika ( life in prison ) , Roman Fidler ( life imprisonment at 1st instance , 25 years on appeal ) , Maria Zolotukinová ( 13 years imprisonment ) and Petr Procházka ( 11 years imprisonment ) . He also tried a case against Andranik Soghojan , an alleged head of Russian mafia , requesting 25 years in prison for ordering a murder . The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence ; however , the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court , and the case will be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court . Another of Mužík 's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus , who was indicted in connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž , a vice @-@ chairman of the Czech Football Association .
