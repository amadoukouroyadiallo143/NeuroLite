 Also that day , expert medical witness Michal Pogoši took the stand . According to The Prague Post , Pogoši testified that Nosek 's cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the brainstem . Pogoši added that the " mortality rate from this kind of injury is around 40 percent , and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient . " Nosek was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place . Since this hospital did not have a specialized neurology department , Nosek was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis . There , Nosek underwent two operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone .
