 Later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , Blythe thought that it was Pořádek again . Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which it did not . Jiří Choroš , author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him . Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up . Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him . It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about Nosek 's death .
