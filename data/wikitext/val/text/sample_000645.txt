 Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the Jaguar Priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at Tikal . It stood 55 metres ( 180 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof lintel , possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD 810 . The temple shrine possesses two chambers .
