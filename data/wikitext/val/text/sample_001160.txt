 The stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks . A second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use . Thus two new stocks were required instead of one . Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds , leaving two options . Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or laminated stocks . Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required . Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds . A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years . Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made .
