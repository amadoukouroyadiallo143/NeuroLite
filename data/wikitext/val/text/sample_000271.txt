 As they move around the city in the van , they pick up different men from the streets to join them . These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen . The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men . As the bridge builds up , Madonna starts fighting with the men . She starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions , while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men . The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink . The video ends with the close @-@ up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette .
