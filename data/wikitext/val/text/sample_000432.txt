 The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace Frehley , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . However , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and fax updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace Frehley was also unenthusiastic towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The Nutty Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to fabricate .
