 Since 2002 , Florida Atlantic students have been using Owl Fingers ( the " OK " hand sign ) to show school pride and wish the athletic teams luck during football point after attempts ( PATs ) and basketball free throws . The Florida Atlantic University Athletics Department has chosen to use Owl Fingers as part of its " Salute the Hoot " 2012 marketing campaign that encourages students to " proudly raise the hand salute that depicts the eyes of the owl , FAU 's mascot .
