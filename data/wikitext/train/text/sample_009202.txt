 The cougar has the largest range of any wild land animal in the Americas . Its range spans 110 degrees of latitude , from northern Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes . Its wide distribution stems from its adaptability to virtually every habitat type : it is found in all forest types , as well as in lowland and mountainous deserts . The cougar prefers regions with dense underbrush , but can live with little vegetation in open areas . Its preferred habitats include precipitous canyons , escarpments , rim rocks , and dense brush .
