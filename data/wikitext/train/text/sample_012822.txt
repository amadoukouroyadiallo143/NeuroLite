In mammalian cells , the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres ( Âµm ) , which occupies about 10 % of the total cell volume . The viscous liquid within it is called nucleoplasm , and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus . It appears as a dense , roughly spherical or irregular organelle .
