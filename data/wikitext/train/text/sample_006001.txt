 Several inscriptions dating to the end of 257 or early 258 show Odaenathus bearing the title " ὁ λαμπρότατος ὑπατικός " ( Clarissimus Consularis ) ; this could be a mere honoring or a sign that he was appointed as the Legatus of Phoenice . However , the title ( ὁ λαμπρότατος ὑπατικός ) was sometimes used in Syria to denote the provincial governor and William Waddington proposed that Odaenathus was indeed the governor of Phoenice .
