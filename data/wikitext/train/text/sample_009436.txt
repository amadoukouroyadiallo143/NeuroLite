 The Source engine itself was updated with new features to accommodate Dota 2 , such as high @-@ end cloth modeling and improved global lighting . The game features Steam integration , which provides its social component and Cloud storage for personal settings . In November 2013 , Valve introduced a coaching system , which allows experienced players to tutor newer players with special in @-@ game tools . As with previous Valve multiplayer titles , players are able to spectate live matches of Dota 2 played by others , and local area network ( LAN ) multiplayer support allows for local competitions . Some of these events may be spectated via the purchase of tickets from the " Dota Store " , which give players in @-@ game access to both live and completed matches . Ticket fees are apportioned in part to tournament organizers . In an upcoming update , Dota 2 will support spectating a game in virtual reality ( VR ) , powered by SteamVR .
