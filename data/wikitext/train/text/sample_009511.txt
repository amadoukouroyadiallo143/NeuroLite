 The invisible rail is thought to be monogamous , but little else is known of its courtship behaviour prior to nesting . A report of 4 â€“ 5 striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect , since such a plumage is not normal for rails . In this family , chicks are typically precocial , downy and black , with any ornamentation confined to the head , bare flesh , or specially modified plume feathers .
