For the killing in 1546 of Anne Askew , charged with heresy and tortured at the Tower of London , a " Substancyall Stage " was built to seat the various officials who presided over her burning .

Instead , " the dounge carte was holden up betwene ij sarjantes , perhaptes syttyng there in a cheare " .
