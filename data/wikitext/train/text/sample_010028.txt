 The ectomycorrhizal structures of H. peckii are among a few in the Bankeraceae that have been studied in detail . They are characterized by a plectenchymatous mantle — a layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation , or palisade , and which rarely branch or overlap each other . These hyphae , along with adhering mineral soil particles , are embedded in a gelatinous matrix . The hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become chlamydospores , an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions . Chlamydospores of H. peckii have a peculiar structure — markedly distinct from those of other Bankeraceae — with thick , smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is split radially into warts . The most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae as a whole is the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed , giving a " carbonized appearance " . The majority of the underground biomass of the fungus is concentrated near the surface , most likely as " mycelial mats " — dense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium . The mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies , as far as 337 centimeters ( 11 @.@ 1 ft ) away .
