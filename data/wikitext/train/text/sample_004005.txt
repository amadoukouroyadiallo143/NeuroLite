 Linus Pauling is credited with the successful prediction of regular protein secondary structures based on hydrogen bonding , an idea first put forth by William Astbury in 1933 . Later work by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation , based partly on previous studies by Kaj Linderstr√∏m @-@ Lang , contributed an understanding of protein folding and structure mediated by hydrophobic interactions .
