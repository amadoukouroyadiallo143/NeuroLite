 During the 2013 summer tour to South America in which Lancaster took an experimental side , England beat a South American select XV before a 2 â€“ 0 series victory over Argentina , a first away series win against The Pumas for 32 years . England hosted the 2015 Rugby World Cup but were eliminated in the Pool stage , earning the unenviable reputation of being the first side in Rugby World Cup history to have hosted the tournament and yet to have failed to qualify for the knockout stages .
