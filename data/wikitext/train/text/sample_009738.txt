 Djedkare seems to have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty . For example , Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare . In addition , the South Saqqara Stone , a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his successor Pepi II , records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king . An estimated 92 % of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid , possibly in the late First Intermediate ( c . 2160 – 2055 BC ) to early Middle Kingdom period ( c . 2055 – 1650 BC ) .
