 He was called up for Spain 's UEFA Euro 2008 squad , where he set up Villa to score Spain 's first goal of the tournament in the first game in the group stage against Russia . Torres came under criticism for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager , Luis Aragonés , after being substituted . He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching , saying that he was actually " irritated with himself " . He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain 's next game , a 2 – 1 win over Sweden . Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1 – 0 victory . He said " It 's just a dream come true . This is my first title and I hope it 's the first of many . Victory in a Euro , it is almost as big as a World Cup . We are used to watching finals on television , but today we were here and we won . My job is to score goals . I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world . " He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner Villa in the Team of the Tournament .
