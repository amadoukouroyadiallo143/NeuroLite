 Djedkare built his pyramid in South Saqqara . It was called Nefer Isesi or Nefer Djedkare in Ancient Egyptian , variously translated as " Isesi / Djedkare is beautiful " or " Isesi / Djedkare is perfect " . It is known today as " Haram el @-@ Shaww√¢f El @-@ Kably " , meaning " the Southern Sentinel pyramid " , because it stands on the edge of the Nile valley .
