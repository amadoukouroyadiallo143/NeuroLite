It is located in the central nave between the main door and the high altar , and built in a semicircular fashion , much like Spanish cathedrals . It was built by Juan de Rojas between 1696 and 1697 . Its sides contain 59 reliefs of various saints done in mahogany , walnut , cedar and a native wood called tepehuaje . The railing that surrounds the choir was made in 1722 by Sangley Queaulo in Macao , China and placed in the cathedral in 1730 .
