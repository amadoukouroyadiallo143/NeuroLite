 The film is based on the concept of reincarnation and eternal love . According to Rediff , the rewritten script 's basic storyline is that " Love remains eternal and it will follow generations and generations . There is always a big victory for Love . " The film 's flashback sequences were used as a flip switch between the film 's olden and present day eras .

However , separate dupattas were used in the film as Rajamouli felt that getting the dupatta from the flashback would complicate the narrative .
