 The funerary cult of Djedkare Isesi enjoyed a revival during the New Kingdom ( c . 1550 â€“ 1077 BCE ) . For the early part of this period , this is best attested by the Karnak king list , a list of kings commissioned by pharaoh Thutmose III . The list was not meant to be exhaustive , rather it gave the names of Thutmose 's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings .
