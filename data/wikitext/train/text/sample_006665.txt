 Bakaara Market was created in late 1972 by the Barre administration . It served as an open market for the sale of goods and services , including produce and clothing . After the start of the civil war , the market was controlled by various militant groups , who used it as a base for their operations . Following Mogadishu 's pacification in 2011 , renovations resumed at the market . Shops were rehabilitated , selling everything from fruit and garments to building materials . As in the rest of the city , Barkaara Market 's real estate values have also risen considerably . As of 2013 , the local Tabaarak firm was renting out a newly constructed warehouse at the market for $ 2 @,@ 000 per month .
