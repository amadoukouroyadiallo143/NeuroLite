 Fraser and Navarro claim that Eva Duarte had no knowledge of or interest in politics prior to meeting Per贸n . Therefore , she never argued with Per贸n or any of his inner circle , but merely absorbed what she heard . Juan Per贸n later claimed in his memoir that he purposefully selected Eva as his pupil , and set out to create in her a " second I. " Fraser and Navarro , however , suggest that Juan Per贸n allowed Eva Duarte such intimate exposure and knowledge of his inner circle because of his age : he was 48 and she was 24 when they met . He had come to politics late in life , and was therefore free of preconceived ideas of how his political career should be conducted , and he was willing to accept whatever aid she offered him .
