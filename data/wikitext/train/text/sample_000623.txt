 Townsend recently discussed at least a year @-@ long hiatus , beginning after the Z Â² show taking place at the Royal Albert Hall on April 13 , 2015 . During the indefinitely long break Townsend intends to " recharge his batteries " , " get some inspiration and experiences " and to " see what the next chapter holds " for him .
