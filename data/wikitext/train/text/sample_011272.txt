During the earlier parts of the era French and English were widely used but Ojibwe , Sioux , and Michif ( the language of the MÃ©tis ) were more widespread . By the late 1850s English had grown to be the most spoken language . New immigrants , though , brought additional languages to the territory . Newspapers were published in German ( Die Minnesota Deutsche Zeitung ) , Swedish ( Minnesota Posten ) , and Norwegian ( Folkets Rost ) .
