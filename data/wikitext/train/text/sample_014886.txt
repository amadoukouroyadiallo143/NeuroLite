 Busch made contact with the artist association Jung M체nchen ( Young Munich ) , met several notable Munich artists , and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung M체nchen newspaper . Kaspar Braun , who published the satirical newspapers M체nchener Bilderbogen ( Picture Sheets from Munich ) and Fliegende Bl채tter ( Flying Leaves ) , proposed a collaboration with Busch . This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live . An existing self @-@ caricature suggests that at this time he had an intense relationship with a woman from Ammerland . His courtship with a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old merchant 's daughter , Anna Richter , whom Busch met through his brother Gustav , ended in 1862 . Busch 's biographer , Diers , suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income .
