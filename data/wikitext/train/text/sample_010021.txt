 As in all mushroom @-@ producing fungi , the fruit bodies ( sporocarps ) are the reproductive structures that are produced from fungal mycelium when the appropriate environmental conditions of temperature , humidity and nutrient availability are met . Hydnellum peckii is a stipitate hydnoid fungus , meaning that it has a cap atop a stipe ( stem ) , and a form resembling a Hydnum â€” characterized by a teeth @-@ like hymenium , rather than gills or pores on the underside of the cap . Fruit bodies growing closely together often appear to fuse together ( this is called " confluence " ) . They can reach a height of up to 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) . Fresh fruit bodies exude a striking , thick red fluid when they are moist .
