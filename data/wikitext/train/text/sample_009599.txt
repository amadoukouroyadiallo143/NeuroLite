 Omaha had terrible streets through the late 1880s , which caused many residents to believe the city was not progressing appropriately .

On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps , and residents wore knee @-@ high boots to wade through the mud , and at times rivers ran through the streets .
