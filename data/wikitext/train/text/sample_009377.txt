 On 4 May 2008 , Torres scored a 57th @-@ minute winner against Manchester City , which equalled the consecutive Anfield league goal record of eight games set by Roger Hunt . After scoring his 24th league goal in the final game of the season , a 2 – 0 win against Tottenham Hotspur , he set a new record for the most prolific foreign goal scorer in a debut season in England , eclipsing Ruud van Nistelrooy 's 23 goals . He ended the season in joint second place with Emmanuel Adebayor in the race for the Premier League golden boot . Torres was subject to media speculation that Chelsea were willing to pay £ 50 million to sign him but Torres responded by saying it would be " many years " before he left Liverpool . Liverpool co @-@ owner Tom Hicks also negated the idea of a transfer , saying he would not allow Torres to leave the club at any price .
