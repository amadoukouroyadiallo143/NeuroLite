 In 1975 , in a seminal paper , Minsky noted that many of his fellow " scruffy " researchers were using the same kind of tool : a framework that captures all our common sense assumptions about something . For example , if we use the concept of a bird , there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind : we might assume that it flies , eats worms and so on . We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be " logical " , but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think . He called these structures " frames " . Schank used a version of frames he called " scripts " to successfully answer questions about short stories in English . Many years later object @-@ oriented programming would adopt the essential idea of " inheritance " from AI research on frames .
