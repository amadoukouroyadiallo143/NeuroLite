The results of the study by BKI were criticized by local planners in May 1982 , who called the study " shabby and unprofessional work " , and asked the state to fire the consulting firm . Local residents distributed 2 @,@ 000 fliers to their neighbors in opposition to the freeway . The South Belt Local Advisory Board criticized BKI 's 110 @-@ page study report as " filled with errors " ; the consultants ' earlier 26 @-@ page paper had been rejected by the board and MDOT as " unusable " . An editorial in the The Grand Rapids Press stated that the study did not help advance the project in the area , instead opening the proposed freeway up to new controversies . Doubts about the state 's budget in 1982 to build the roadway combined with issues over the consultants and their study results .
