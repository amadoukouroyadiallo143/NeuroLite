 Prior to abandoning Juana Ibarguren , Juan Duarte had been her sole means of support . Biographer , John Barnes , writes that after this abandonment , all Duarte left to the family was a document declaring that the children were his , thus enabling them to use the Duarte surname . Soon after , Juana moved her children to a one @-@ room apartment in Jun√≠n . To pay the rent on their single @-@ roomed home , mother and daughters took up jobs as cooks in the houses of the local estancias .
