 The battery had a complement of some one hundred men in all . These were chiefly gunnery crews , of course , such as my team , but also included staff officers and their assistants , medical , cooks , observation teams , maintenance teams and guards with side arms .

It was a remarkable structure , and it featured prominently in propaganda of the time â€¦
