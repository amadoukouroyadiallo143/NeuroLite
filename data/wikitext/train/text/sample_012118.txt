 Arab Christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works . They adopted the Muslim bismill훮h , and also created their own Trinitized bismill훮h as early as the 8th century . The Muslim bismill훮h reads : " In the name of God , the Compassionate , the Merciful . " The Trinitized bismill훮h reads : " In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit , One God . " The Syriac , Latin and Greek invocations do not have the words " One God " at the end . This addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of Trinitarian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims .
