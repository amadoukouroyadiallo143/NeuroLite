 Blood transfusion was formerly the second @-@ most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease , but the development and implementation of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century .

In Spain , donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests .
