 In the 20th century , the study of mathematical logic provided the essential breakthrough that made artificial intelligence seem plausible . The foundations had been set by such works as Boole 's The Laws of Thought and Frege 's Begriffsschrift . Building on Frege 's system , Russell and Whitehead presented a formal treatment of the foundations of mathematics in their masterpiece , the Principia Mathematica in 1913 .

" His question was answered by GÃ¶del 's incompleteness proof , Turing 's machine and Church 's Lambda calculus . Their answer was surprising in two ways .
