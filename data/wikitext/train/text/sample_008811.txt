 On 1 September 1910 , the design board chose the 30 @.@ 5 cm , to be mounted in four twin turrets on the centerline of the ship . The armor layout was kept the same as in Seydlitz .

This proved unfeasible , because neither the armor or armament firms could supply the necessary materials according to an expedited schedule .
