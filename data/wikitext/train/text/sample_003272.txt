 The first adaptation of Hellblazer ever filmed for the screen is one of the scenes in the documentary feature film The Mindscape of Alan Moore , which was shot in early 2002 . The dramatization consists of the John Constantine character wandering through London and , in the film ending , experiencing a mystical epiphany of sorts .
