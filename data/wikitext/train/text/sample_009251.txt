 Dr. Ruy d 'Andrade gave the breed their name of " Sorraia " . D 'Andrade took the name from the Sorraia River in Portugal . The breed had previously been known by the local Portuguese as " zebro " or " zebra " , due to their markings . In the time of Christopher Columbus , the Sorraia was also known as the Marisme単o , but the Sorraia and the Marisme単o have evolved into two different breeds over time . Today , the name Marisme単o refers to a population of semiferal horses living in Do単ana Natural Park in Spain .
