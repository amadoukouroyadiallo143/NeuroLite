 He was a man of some education , with knowledge of French and calligraphy . In signing his accounts for 1621 and 1622 as chamberlain he decorated them with a couplet in French from a romance by Mellin de Saint @-@ Gelais . Quiney writes “ Bien heureux est celui qui pour devenir sage , Qui pour le mal d 'autrui fait son apprentissage ” but the original is “ Heureux celui qui pour devenir sage , Du mal d 'autrui fait son apprentissage ” . The original translates into English as “ Happy is he who to become wise , serves his apprenticeship from other men 's troubles ” but Quiney 's version “ … is ungrammatical and without sense ” .
