Then , Rio officials participated in the Olympic Games Observers Program from August 8 to 24 , during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China ; and attended the IOC Official Debriefing of the Beijing Games from November 24 to 27 , in London , United Kingdom .

Rio officials came out stronger after a presentation of 45 minutes , considered to be exceptional , followed by a session of 16 questions .
