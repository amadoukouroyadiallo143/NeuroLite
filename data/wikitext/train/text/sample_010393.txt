 Tammareddy Bharadwaja said " Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera did well at the box office , the rest of the industry started following their footsteps . Also , since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now , producers are turning towards mythological films . It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film . But what they don 't realize is that if these films flop , the blow to the producer will be severe . " Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu ( 2011 ) and Shakti ( 2011 ) were commercial failures and Badrinath ( 2012 ) was an average grosser ; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior . The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former 's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera . Producer Natti Kumar said " If a hero delivers a hit , producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops . It 's the same story with movies . Since Magadheera became a hit , every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores . They don 't work on the script , story or relevance . It is a pure display of graphics , heroes ' abs and grandeur . The plot is lost . Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then , but why will people want to see the same things again ? " .
