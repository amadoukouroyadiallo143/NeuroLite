 In the late 1970s and early 1980s Franklin A. Davis synthesized the first N @-@ sulfonyloxaziridines , which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents , and are the most predominantly used class of oxaziridines today . While originally synthesized with mCPBA and the phase transfer catalyst benzyltrimethylammonium chloride , an improved synthesis using oxone as the oxidant is now most prevalent .
