 Like many American films of the time , The Heart of Ezra Greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . The Chicago Board of Censors required the cutting in Reel 2 of a letter stating , " I cannot face my father , " etc . , and two closeups of gambling scenes ; and in Reel 5 a change of the intertitle " Because it means her whole future " to " Because she is his wife " .
