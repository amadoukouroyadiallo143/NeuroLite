 The La Cobata region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the Olmec heartland . The La Cobata colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas , on the north side of El Vigia volcano near to Santiago Tuxtla . The head was largely buried when found ; excavations uncovered a Late Classic ( 600 â€“ 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @-@ centimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long obsidian knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted . The La Cobata head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago .
