 The Kingdom of Tondo once ruled in the vicinity of Manila before it briefly became a province of the Hindu Majapahit Empire . During the Brunei invasion of the Philippines , Sultan Bolkiah of Brunei captured Seludong ( a village in modern @-@ day Manila ) and renamed it Maynilà , a Tagalog term referring to the presence of the Nila shrub . Maynila was a vassal state of Brunei , established to overpower Tondo . Maynilà had been Indianized since the sixth century CE and earlier . It had become partly Islamic and Hindu @-@ animist by the 15th century CE .
