 The first Bintulu palm oil refinery , Bintulu Edible Oil Sdn Bhd , was established in June 1991 . Bintulu currently has four palm oil refineries : Bintulu Edible Oils Sdn Bhd ( operated under PGEO Group , a subsidiary of Wilmar International ) , Sime Darby Austral Edible Oil Sdn Bhd , Kirana Palm Oil Refinery Sdn Bhd , and Sarawak Oil Palm Bhd . However , as of 2015 , Wilmar no longer buys raw palm oil produced from cleared forests and peat swamps in Sarawak because of environmental concerns .
