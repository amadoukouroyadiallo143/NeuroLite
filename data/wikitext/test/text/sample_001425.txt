 Violence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the Bogside â€” a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the RUC . On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the Bogside and the RUC were withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association ( DCDA ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the RUC and the British Army until their demands were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in .
