 Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching prodigy , but is not interested in self @-@ promotion . He instead prefers to deflect the praise he receives to the players , athletic department , and his mentors . He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " .
