The head measures 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 9 @.@ 4 tons . The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The monument was found 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to the Museo de Antropolog√≠a de Xalapa . The headdress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords , with diagonal folds above each eye . A small skullcap tops the headdress . A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears . The face has a typically frowning brow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions .
