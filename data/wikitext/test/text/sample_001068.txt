 This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @-@ km tall Malapert Mountain , a peak that is perpetually visible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped .
