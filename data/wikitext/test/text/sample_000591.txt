 The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( ECC ) , which was set up in the JAO . A 44 @-@ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the ECC was planned for insertion with the CH @-@ 53E Super Stallions after they had returned to the Guam . However , this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail . The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail . The evacuees were grouped into 15 @-@ person " sticks " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece . Some attempted to bring more , resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation . Furthermore , many evacuees had pets they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . Most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . Meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's commissary , such as candy , sodas , and souvenirs ( most had been stationed on ships for several months ) . They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; the medic filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship .
