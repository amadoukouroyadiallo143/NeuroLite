 In 422 , Augustine of Hippo wrote about 2 Thessalonians 2 : 1 â€“ 11 , where he believed Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist . Though he rejects the theory , Augustine mentions that many Christians believed that Nero was the Antichrist or would return as the Antichrist . He wrote , " so that in saying , ' For the mystery of iniquity doth already work , ' he alluded to Nero , whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist . "
