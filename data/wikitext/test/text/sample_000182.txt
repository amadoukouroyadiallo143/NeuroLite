 Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31 , Keiser had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of Changnyong . In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road . They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes .
