 Kershaw made his third straight opening day start for the Dodgers in the 2013 season , the first Dodger starter to do so since Derek Lowe ( 2005 – 2007 ) . In that opening day start he pitched a complete game , four hit , shutout over the Giants and also hit his first career home run . He was the first pitcher to throw a shutout and hit a home run on opening day since Bob Lemon of the Cleveland Indians did so against the Chicago White Sox on April 14 , 1953 . Kershaw picked up his 1,000th career strikeout on April 17 , 2013 , when he struck out Yonder Alonso of the Padres . He was the second youngest Dodger to reach that mark , behind only Fernando Valenzuela . On May 14 , Kershaw passed the 1 @,@ 000 inning mark for his career . His ERA of 2 @.@ 70 at the time was the fifth best of the live @-@ ball era at the 1 @,@ 000 inning mark and the best career mark . He also threw 130 pitches that day , the most of his career and the most by a Dodger pitcher since Odalis Pérez in the 2003 season .
