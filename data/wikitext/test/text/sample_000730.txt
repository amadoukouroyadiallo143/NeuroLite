 The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen. Mikhail Kutuzov also maneuvered away from the French , withdrawing to the east . At the Ill river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von Kienmayer . On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in Amstetten . On 7 November the Russians arrived in St. PÃ¶lten and crossed the Danube river the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the Danube , holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near the village Krems , until the late afternoon .
