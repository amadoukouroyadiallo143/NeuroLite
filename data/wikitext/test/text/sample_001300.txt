 Upon drafting a new charter for Manila in June 1901 , the Americans made official what had long been tacit : that the City of Manila was not Intramuros alone but also all its arrabales . The new city charter proclaimed that Manila was composed of eleven municipal districts — presumably Tondo , Binondo , Santa Cruz , Sampaloc , San Miguel , Pandacan , Santa Ana , Paco , Malate , Ermita and Intramuros . In addition to these , the Church recognized five parishes as Manileno — namely , Gagalangin , Trozo , Balic @-@ Balic , Santa Mesa and Singalong . Later times would add two more : Balut and San Andres Bukid .
