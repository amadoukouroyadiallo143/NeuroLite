 Around this time , the American Imagist Amy Lowell moved to London , determined to promote her own work and that of the other Imagist poets . Lowell was a wealthy heiress from Boston whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 1909 @-@ 1933 . She loved Keats and cigars . She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group . Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound 's autocratic editorial attitude to a more democratic manner . This new editorial policy was stated in the Preface to the first anthology to appear under her leadership : " In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the only stipulation being that it should not yet have appeared in book form . " The outcome was a series of Imagist anthologies under the title Some Imagist Poets . The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly by H.D. and Aldington . Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 . These three volumes featured most of the original poets , ( also including imagist poetry by the American poet John Gould Fletcher ) , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop the Imagist name from her publications and who sardonically dubbed this phase of Imagism " Amy @-@ gism .
