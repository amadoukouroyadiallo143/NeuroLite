 On 18 May 1991 , the Zrinski Battalion was established as a special forces unit of the ZNG . The core of the unit consisted of 27 volunteers drawn from the Kumrovec Special Police Unit ( SPU ) . Initially , it relied on former French Foreign Legion troops . The most senior among the former legionnaires was Ante Roso , previously a Sous @-@ Officier ( non @-@ commissioned officer – NCO ) in the 4th Foreign Regiment . In consequence , Roso was tasked with setting up the unit as its initial commander . Major Miljenko Filipović , likewise a former French Foreign Legion member , was assigned the battalions deputy commander . The unit was based in the village of Kumrovec in the region of Hrvatsko Zagorje , on the grounds of the former " Josip Broz Tito " political school . The site , adjacent to the border of Slovenia , was selected to be inaccessible to Yugoslav Air Force raids without violation of Slovene or possibly Austrian airspace . In June 1991 , the Kumrovec SPU was transferred to Sljeme Peak north of Zagreb leaving Kumrovec base to the Zrinski Battalion , as well as the second special forces unit , the Frankopan Battalion .
