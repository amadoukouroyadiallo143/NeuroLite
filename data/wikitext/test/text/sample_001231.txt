 In 65 , Gaius Calpurnius Piso , a Roman statesman , organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper , a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard . According to Tacitus , many conspirators wished to " rescue the state " from the emperor and restore the Republic . The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero 's secretary , Epaphroditos . As a result , the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan , the poet . Nero 's previous advisor , Seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators .
