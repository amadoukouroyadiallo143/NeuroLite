 Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist . Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with World War I as a backdrop , the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary movements ( Aldington , for example , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement .
