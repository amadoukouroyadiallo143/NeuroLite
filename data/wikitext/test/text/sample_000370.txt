 Another group called Microsauria was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classified Microsauria as a subgroup of Labyrinthodontia , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like animals within it . Among them were Dendrerpeton , once placed in Ganocephala . Dendrerpeton was later placed as a labyrinthodont with other temnospondyls , but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians .
