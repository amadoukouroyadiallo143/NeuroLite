 The following night on Raw , WWE 's Chief Operating Officer Triple H refused to give in to Lesnar 's unreasonable contract demands ( which included being given his own personal jet and having Raw renamed to Monday Night Raw Starring Brock Lesnar ) , resulting in Lesnar attacking him and breaking his arm with a Kimura lock in storyline . The next week on Raw , Paul Heyman made his return as Lesnar 's legal representative and claimed that Lesnar was quitting WWE . He later announced a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract . At No Way Out in June , Triple H challenged Lesnar , who was not present , to a match at SummerSlam which Lesnar refused . Stephanie McMahon would later goad Heyman into accepting the match on Lesnar 's behalf on July 23 at Raw 1000 . On August 19 , at SummerSlam , Lesnar defeated Triple H in a No Disqualification match via submission after once again breaking his arm in storyline . The following night on Raw , Lesnar declared himself the new " King of Kings " and said that he would depart from WWE after his victory over Triple H , stating that he had conquered everything in the company .
