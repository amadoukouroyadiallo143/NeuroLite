 Until 1805 , DÃ¼renstein was probably best known as the village in which crusader Richard the Lionheart was held by Leopold V , Duke of Austria . In 1741 , during the War of the Austrian Succession , several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on drums , thus suggesting the presence of a large force .
