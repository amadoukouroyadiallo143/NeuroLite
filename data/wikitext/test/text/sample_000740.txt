 Together , Schmitt , Kutuzov and the other generals , with von Stiebar 's advice on the local terrain , concocted a plan to encircle the French at DÃ¼renstein . Russian commander Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich would approach Gazan 's division from the east , supported by Petr Bagration 's corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional columns , commanded by Dmitry Dokhturov ( Doctorov ) , Maj. Gen. Strik and Schmitt , would outflank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at Krems .
