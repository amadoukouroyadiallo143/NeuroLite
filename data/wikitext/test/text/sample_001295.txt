 Manila then became famous during the Manila @-@ Acapulco Galleon trade which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe , Africa and Latin America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia ( Which was already an entrepot for goods coming from India , Indonesia and China ) and trade also flowed vice versa . Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru were exchanged for Chinese silk , Indian gems , and the spices of the Southeast Asia , some of which even flowed to Europe . Likewise wines and olives grown from Europe and North Africa were transshipped via Mexico towards Manila .
