 The Lockport Bypass , a highway bypassing downtown Lockport to the southwest , was opened to traffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction of NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) and Dysinger Road ( CR 133 ) to Akron Road in Royalton . The portion of Akron Road ( NY 93 's former routing ) east of the Lockport city limits became NY 954M , an unsigned reference route .
