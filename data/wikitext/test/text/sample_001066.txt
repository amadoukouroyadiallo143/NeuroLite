 Some sites along Shackleton 's rim receive almost constant illumination . At these locales sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night .
