 Again , on the same day , the Vichy French government issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded . As a result , six bomber squadrons of the Vichy French Air Force ( Arm√©e de l 'Air de Vichy ) and four squadrons of the Vichy French Navy ( Marine nationale de Vichy ) were employed in the operation . The 64 bombers flew from bases in Oran , Tafaroui ( in Algeria ) , Meknes , Mediouna , and Port Lyautey ( in Morocco ) . The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission .
