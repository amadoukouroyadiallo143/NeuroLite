 In 2010 , Arjona wanted to change his musical style ; after experimenting with using as few instruments as possible , he obtained a sound similar to an a capella performance ( simplifying his sound ) and introduced what he called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " to his music . This was heard on his twelfth studio album , Poquita Ropa . Arjona produced the album with Dan Warner , who has worked with Shakira , Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera . When promoting the album Arjona said , " [ songs ] are like women ; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes , more beauty . The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves , because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them " . Poquita Ropa became the first album since Adentro which Arjona recorded without Torres .
