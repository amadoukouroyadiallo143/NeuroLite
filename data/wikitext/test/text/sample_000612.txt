 Composed and written in a year , the record marks Arjona and Torres ' fourth collaboration . For Independiente , Arjona returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for Poquita Ropa ( 2010 ) . While producing the latter , he had used fewer instruments to simplify his sound , having introduced what had been called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " in his music . Independiente has been compared to his earlier recordings , Historias ( 1994 ) and Animal Nocturno ( 1993 ) .
