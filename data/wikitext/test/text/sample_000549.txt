 In 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to the Eiffel Tower group : his former fianc√©e Hilda Doolittle ( who had started signing her work H.D. ) and her future husband Richard Aldington . These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models , especially Sappho , an interest that Pound shared . The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto @-@ Imagist interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room , Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing .
