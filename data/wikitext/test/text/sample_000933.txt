 Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot plungers , popcorn or bubble gum . Donald has unlimited plungers which can only temporarily stun enemies ( though bosses can still be damaged with plungers ) , and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose . Later in the game , the plunger is upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows Donald to traverse longer distances . In Duckburg , India and Egypt , Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper , eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible , increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path .
