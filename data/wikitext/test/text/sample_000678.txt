 Late in October , an area of convection persisted northwest of Palau and quickly organized into a tropical depression on October 29 . Moving west @-@ northwestward toward the Philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Melor on October 30 . With minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . The JTWC upgraded Melor to typhoon status on October 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , although the JMA estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Early on November 1 , Melor made landfall on northeastern Luzon in the Philippines , south of Palanan . The storm weakened over land and emerged into the South China Sea . By that time , it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east . On November 2 , Melor turned to the northeast , passing just east of Taiwan . The next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and after meandering offshore eastern Taiwan , Melor continued northeastward . It became extratropical on November 5 and dissipated the next day near southern Japan .
