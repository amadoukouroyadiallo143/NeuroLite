 After the afternoon 's initial skirmishing with the French , Kutuzov held a council of war on the evening of 10 November at Melk , at the great abbey there . He knew several things . First , he knew the positions of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured . He also knew that Gazan had crossed at Linz and was well ahead of any French reinforcements : Dupont had crossed at Passau and , by 10 November , stood at Marbach , 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) upstream , and Dumonceau was another 7 kilometers ( 4 mi ) further behind him . Kutuzov knew the size of the French force--its division strength--and its positions , and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north . He also knew , or had made a good supposition , about Napoleon 's orders , so he knew what to offer Mortier and Gazan as bait .
