 The first public library in Bintulu was built in 1971 by Bintulu District Council ( BDC ) . In 1988 the library was demolished to make way for car parks . Books from the library were moved into the former BDC building . On 29 May 2000 , the Bintulu Development Authority ( BDA ) public library was built near the Bintulu Civic Centre , which is 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the town . The public library has three branches : at Kidurong , Tatau , and Sebauh .
