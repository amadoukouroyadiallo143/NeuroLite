 The transfer of acylated amines is more difficult than that of unsubstituted amines , although , unlike amine transfer by oxaziridines , there are no alternative methods that directly transfer acylated amines . Acylamine transfer has primarily been performed using amines and hydrazines as nucleophiles . Very few transfers of acylated nitrogens to carbon nucleophiles have been successfully performed , although some do exist in the literature .
