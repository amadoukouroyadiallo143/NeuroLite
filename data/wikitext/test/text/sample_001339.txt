 The Pandacan Oil Depot houses the storage facilities and distribution terminals of the three major players in the country 's petroleum industry , namely Caltex Philippines , Pilipinas Shell and Petron Corporation . The oil depot has been a subject of various concerns , including its environmental and health impact to the residents of Manila . The Supreme Court has ordered that the oil depot to be relocated outside the city by July 2015 , but it failed to meet this deadline . It is currently being demolished which is expected to be finished before the year 2016 ends , and plans have been set up to turn this 33 hectare facility into a transport hub or even a food park .
