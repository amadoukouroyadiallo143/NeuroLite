 After the London Paralympics , Dodd took up wheelchair basketball . She started for the Sydney University Flames in the Women 's National Wheelchair Basketball League in 2013 . She has to strap her fingers and wrists , and usually dislocates a shoulder during a game . " I 've had a few bangs and scrapes and been tipped out of my chair a few times , " she concedes , " but it 's really fun . The fast pace really gives you an adrenalin kick and the girls I play with are awesome . " " If I have chose between my two sports for Rio , " she said , " I will go with basketball . " She made her debut with the national team , known as the Gliders , at the Osaka Cup in Osaka in February 2015 . The Gliders won bronze . In June 2015 , Dodd was selected as part of the under 25 team ( known as the Devils ) for the 2015 Women 's U25 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship in Beijing in July . The Devils won silver . By this time her health had deteriorated . She had to use a wheelchair much of the time , and her classification had dropped to a 2 @.@ 5 point player . In 2015 , she was reclassified a 2 @.@ 0 .
