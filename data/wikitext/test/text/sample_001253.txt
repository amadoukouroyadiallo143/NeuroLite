 The history of Nero 's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero . These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and fantastical , either overly critical or praising of Nero . The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name . Fabius Rusticus , Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost . There were also pro @-@ Nero histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised .
