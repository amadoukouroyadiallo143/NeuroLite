 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 4 ( also known as San Lorenzo Monument 4 ) weighs 6 tons and has been moved to the Museo de Antropolog√≠a de Xalapa . Colossal Head 4 is 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high , 1 @.@ 17 metres ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946 , 550 metres ( 600 yd ) northwest of the principal mound , at the edge of a gully . When excavated , it was found to be lying on its right @-@ hand side and in a very good state of preservation . Ceramic materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument difficult . The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted cords , similar to those of Head 3 . On the right @-@ hand side , three tassels descend from the upper portion of the headdress ; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band . These tassels are judged to represent hair rather than cords . Also on the right hand side , two cords descend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument . On the left @-@ hand side , three vertical cords descend across the ear . The earflare is only visible on the right hand side ; it is formed of a plain disc and peg . The face is that of an ageing man with a creased forehead , low cheekbones and a prominent chin . The lips are thick and slightly parted .
