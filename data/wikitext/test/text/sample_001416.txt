 The fruit are dispersed by animals ; fruit which are not dispersed frequently suffer seed predation by bruchid beetles . Certain species of Attalea have been mentioned as examples of " anachronistic " species which are adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene megafauna . On Marac√° Island , Roraima , in the Brazilian Amazon , Attalea maripa fruit were consumed by tapirs , collared peccaries , deer and primates . Rodents , including agoutis , fed upon the fruit and , as the fruit availability declined , they fed on the seeds . Other dispersers of Attalea fruit include Crested Caracaras which consume the fruit and disperse the seeds of A. phalerata in the Brazilian Pantanal .
