 The region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practiced viticulture and the wine producers formed St. Paul Vintners ' Guild in 1447 , the oldest such guild in the German @-@ speaking world . Terraced vineyards extended up the sides of the Krems River until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation . The Loiben plain supported both viticulture and agriculture . As the terrain became steeper , the vines grew in terraces built from the dark Urgestein , primordial rock . From DÃ¼renstein to Krems the river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear line @-@ of @-@ sight between the two towns .
