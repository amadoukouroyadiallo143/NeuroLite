 On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ maintained highway , and reassign it to Junction Road ( NY 270 ) and Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) . The impetus for the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was passed . NYSDOT obliged to the request in 2006 , rerouting NY 93 as proposed and truncating NY 270 southward to NY 31 .
