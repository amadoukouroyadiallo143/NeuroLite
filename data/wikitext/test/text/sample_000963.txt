 San Lorenzo Colossal Head 5 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 5 . The monument stands 1 @.@ 86 metres ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 47 metres ( 4 @.@ 8 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 15 metres ( 3 @.@ 8 ft ) deep . It weighs 11 @.@ 6 tons . The head was discovered by Matthew Stirling in 1946 , face down in a gully to the south of the principal mound . The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location . Ceramics recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head 4 . The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases ( approximately 1400 – 1000 BC and 800 – 1000 AD respectively ) . Colossal Head 5 is particularly well preserved , although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site . The band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The headdress is decorated with jaguar paws ; this general identification of the decoration is contested by Beatriz de la Fuente since the " paws " have three claws each ; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey . At the back of the head , ten interlaced strips form a net decorated with disc motifs . Two short straps descend from the headdress in front of the ears . The ears are adorned with disc @-@ shaped earspools with pegs . The face is that of an ageing man with wrinkles under the eyes and across the bridge of the nose , and a forehead that is creased in a frown . The lips are slightly parted . Colossal Head 5 has been moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa .
