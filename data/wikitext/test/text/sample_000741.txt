 On the night of 10 – 11 November a Russian column under Strik 's command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent on arriving at Dürenstein by noon ; two more columns , under Dokhtorov and Schmitt , moved in wider semicircles , planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank . According to the plan , in late morning Strik 's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right . This flanking attack , combined with Miloradovich 's frontal assault from Stein , would force the French into a vise ; encircled , they would have no option but to surrender--or die . To ensure the success of the plan , the second and third columns , under Dokhtorov and Schmitt , would arrive in early and mid @-@ afternoon and support the earlier assaults . In this way , even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach , they would not escape the vise @-@ like grip of the Coalition army .
