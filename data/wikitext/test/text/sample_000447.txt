 With the signing of Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard , Manchester United allowed Amos to join Oldham Athletic on loan for the remainder of the season on 7 January 2011 , although he would continue to train with Manchester United once a week . He made his debut against Swindon Town the next day and kept a clean sheet . However , three days later , he conceded all six goals in a 6 â€“ 0 defeat at home to Southampton ; he allowed Adam Lallana 's 20 @-@ yard shot underneath his body for the second goal , and he was rounded by Lee Barnard for the sixth .
