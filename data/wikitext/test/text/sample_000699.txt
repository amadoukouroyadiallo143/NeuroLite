 Additionally , oxidation of chiral imines and oxidation of imines with chiral peracids may yield enantiopure oxaziridines . Some oxaziridines have the unique property of configurationally stable nitrogen atoms at room temperature due to an inversion barrier of 24 to 31 kcal / mol . Enantiopure oxaziridines where stereochemistry is entirely due to configurationally stable nitrogen are reported .
