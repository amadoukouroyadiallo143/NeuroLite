 Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffrey Birley and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham . The site chosen at Lord Airey 's Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing tunnelling scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier @-@ Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott â€™ s ill @-@ fated expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray Levick was called up as Surgeon @-@ Commander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operation Tracer was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front .
