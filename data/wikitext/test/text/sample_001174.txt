 Nero 's father , Gnaeus , was the son of Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus ( consul 16 BC ) and Antonia Major . Gnaeus was thus the grandson of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus ( consul 32 BC ) and probably Aemilia Lepida on his father 's side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor on his mother 's side . Thus , Nero had as his paternal grandmother Antonia Major , and also claimed more remote descent from Antonia Minor as a great @-@ grandson â€” later grandson after Claudius adopted him .
