 In the broader picture , despite the important major naval engagements , the outcome of the War of the Third Coalition was determined on the Continent , predominantly in the two major land operations . In the Ulm campaign , the Habsburgs achieved some minor victories , such as Klenau 's at Haslach @-@ Jungingen , but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms against France until formally exchanged . This condition crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners as Schmitt out of retirement . After the capitulation at Ulm , isolated portions of the Austrian military evaded capture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von Kienmayer 's corps slipped out of the encirclement and joined Kutuzov 's force . A few other small forces refused to capitulate and seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and the Thurgingian forests , to reappear in Bohemia for Austerlitz . Sixteen hundred cavalry , including Archduke Ferdinand and Prince Schwarzenberg , broke out of Ulm before its capitulation . Maximilian , Count of Merveldt , led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at the Steyer ( Steyr ) and Mariazell . These elusive units were insufficient to balance heavy losses at key battles in which the Austrians could not hold their own against the French . Between the Ulm capitulation and the Austrian and Russian defeat at Austerlitz , there were other minor achievements : a successful skirmish between the cavalry that escaped from Ulm and the French near the town of Nördlingen , the contested victory at Dürenstein , and another within days at Schöngrabern .
