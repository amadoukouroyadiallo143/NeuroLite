 With highly electron withdrawing perfluoroalkyl substituents , oxaziridines exhibit reactivity more similar to that of dioxiranes than typical oxaziridines . Notably , perfluoroalkyloxaziridines hydroxylate certain C @-@ H bonds with high selectivity . Perfluorinated oxaziridines may be synthesized by subjecting a perfluorinated imine to perfluoromethyl fluorocarbonyl peroxide and a metal fluoride to act as an HF scavenger .
