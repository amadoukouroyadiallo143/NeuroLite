 The Imagists rejected the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast , Imagism called for a return to what were seen as more Classical values , such as directness of presentation and economy of language , as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms . Imagists use free verse .
