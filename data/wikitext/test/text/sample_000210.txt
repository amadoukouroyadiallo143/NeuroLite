 In 2006 , Hed PE signed with Suburban Noize Records , recording their fifth studio album , Back 2 Base X. The album was intended as a return to the basics of rock music , and did not rely as heavily on studio enhancement as previous releases . The album was released on June 6 , 2006 , the same day as The Best of ( həd ) Planet Earth , a compilation album produced by Jive Records without the band 's authorization or consent . Back 2 Base X peaked at No. 12 on the Independent Albums chart , and at No. 154 on the Billboard 200 . Allmusic 's Rob Theakston wrote that " Back 2 Base X suffers from the same problems as Amerika : it tries to be conceptual in thought à la Tool and vicious in its political commentary à la Fugazi or System of a Down , but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox . It won 't win any new fans , but existing fans of ( hed ) pe 's work won 't be turning their backs away from the band in anger anytime soon , either . "
