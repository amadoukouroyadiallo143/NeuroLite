 Another transformation of high synthetic utility is asymmetric epoxidation . A number of asymmetric epoxidations exist : the Sharpless epoxidation , the Jacobsen @-@ Katsuki epoxidation , and the Juliá @-@ Colonna Epoxidation . These methods require specific functionality in order to achieve selectivity . The Sharpless epoxidation is specific to allylic alcohols , the Jacobsen epoxidation requires cis @-@ disubstituted aryl alkenes , and the Juliá epoxidation requires α @-@ β unsaturated ketones . Chiral oxaziridines act stereospecifically on many unfunctionalized alkenes . It has even possible to effect stereospecific epoxidation catalytically in the oxaziridine chiral unit . Further investigation into these reactions may be required before levels of enantiometic excess become practical for large scale synthesis . Lusinichi et al. have investigated asymmetric epoxidation with a chiral oxaziridinium salt using oxone as the stoichiometric oxidant seen below .
