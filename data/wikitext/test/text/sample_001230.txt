 In 60 , a major rebellion broke out in the province of Britannia . While the governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona ( Anglesey ) from the druids , the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queen Boudica of the Iceni . Boudica and her troops destroyed three cities before the army of Paulinus could return , receive reinforcements , and quell the rebellion in 61 . Fearing Paulinus himself would provoke further rebellion , Nero replaced him with the more passive Publius Petronius Turpilianus .
