 Epoxidation of alkenes is a common reaction because epoxides can be derivatized in a number of useful ways . Classically , laboratory epoxidation is carried out with mCPBA or other peracids . Oxaziridines have been found to be useful for the formation of highly acid sensitive epoxides . ( âˆ’ ) -Chaetominine was synthesized via oxaziridine epoxidation as a late stage transformation as seen below .
