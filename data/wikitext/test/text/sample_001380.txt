 Manila has the most number of barangays of any city or municipality in the Philippines . Attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation — Ordinance 7907 , passed on 23 April 1996 — reducing the number from 897 to 150 by merging existing barangays , because of the failure to hold a plebiscite .
