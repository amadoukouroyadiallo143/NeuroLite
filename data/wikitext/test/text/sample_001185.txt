 Very early in Nero 's rule , problems arose from competition for influence between Agrippina and Nero 's two main advisers , Seneca and Burrus . Agrippina also attempted to influence the young Nero . Agrippina also is mentioned by ancient sources as " scheming for her son ( Nero ) " . This scheming continued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them . It is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world . It is because of this position of power Agrippina felt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in Nero 's court as he offered the advice Nero wanted to hear unlike his mother .
