 In 1987 a clock tower and a fountain were erected at Council Negri Monument . A centenary stone that was erected in 1967 to commemorate the event is kept under the clock tower . The Bintulu Tua Pek Kong temple ( near Tamu Bintulu ) is believed to have been built in the 1890s to purge the town from evil spirits . The temple survived World War II , and was rebuilt after the discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore .
