 The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depression Lakay near the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vamco to the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of Taipei , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed Vamco as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China .
